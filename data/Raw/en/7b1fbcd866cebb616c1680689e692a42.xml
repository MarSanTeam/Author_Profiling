		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Trudeau has screwed up pretty much everything since day 1, lied abt them, &amp; still allows travel from countries w/ own variants: Brazil &amp; India. Popularity up. Ford has been fighting a losing war against such stupidity but can’t overrule federal level authority. Popularity down.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# There’s only 5 main global climates (see attached). Why does no one pressure Trudeau to answer: to which other climate category is Canada shifting? &amp; temperature change &amp; draining a lake that’s been flooding since pre Colombian times &amp; calling it a ‘plains’ isn’t climate change.’ #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well, you can drain “Sumas Lake” &amp; rename it “Sumas Prairie” all you want. NATURE is NOT going to obey a “declaration”. If nature has decided it shall be “Sumas Lake”, it will be. Stop scamming naive property buyers by draining lakes &amp; trying to pass them off them as “prairies”!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Got this book in the mail yesterday; about Cdn Liberal PM Mackenzie King’s admiration for Hitler’s Nazis. Seems aspects of that admiration are still baked right into the party and survive right up to today, though they deflect, project and pretend to be “liberal”. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well, they’re invoking the language of terrorism regarding the ‘incitement’. Maybe they’ll just settle with demanding Trump’s personal jet (Trump Force One) be grounded permanently for being a ‘potential threat’ &amp; put him on the no-fly list. Anything to not have to do real work.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Telus was involved. Telus uses Huawei equipment. That’s pretty simple math right there…maybe that’s why Trudeau in October said he’d announce a decision whether to ban Huawei, then backtracked and said absolutely nothing more since.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Absolutely. And it should’ve been aggressively outed for what it was: “foreign interference” in our electoral sovereignty.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[If the science from South Africa, UK, &amp; elsewhere is now saying that omicron is more like the flu, then will we now be restricting air travel &amp; reducing large venues by half every year during flu season from now on? I mean, I’m assuming that’s how science works…right? #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# This is the problem w/ weak ldrship. He lost what should’ve been a relatively easy elxn; that led some members gunning to oust him; yet he’s supposed to threaten those same mmbrs in caucus to wear masks. Interesting way to use a mask mandate to try to decapitate the opposition.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# New class division: sullied and unsullied. So you’ll need to decide soon: injectedly pure, or unblemishedly disgusting. (It’s rare that I to invent new language to describe today’s world.)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My bet: she’s getting ready to launch a coup against Trudeau. She started her own “leadership” page in 2019 just after his serial blackface episodes - probably figured he was going to lose that election - but she just renewed her registration of that webpage last month. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The CCP already has this sensitive info, since their actors were directly involved. Canadian voters who can vote Trudeau out of office do not have it. Conclusion: guess which one of the two the Trudeau government now considers to be “the adversary.”]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Can’t wait til Trudeau’s Space Agency launches lunar rover using ‘subjective’ math. #USER# shud ATIP now to learn if CSA is using new ’anti-racist/oppressive’ math, or if they’re still using old racist math &amp; we need to start tearing down racist CSA buildings.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Prediction 1: through a lot of ‘apparent’ political wrangling &amp; legal negotiation, the Liberal govt will end up buying Line 5 from Enbridge. 

Prediction 2: in years to come it’ll be revealed that Trudeau &amp; Whitmer actually discussed/negotiated setting up this fiasco in advance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So...it withheld offering assistance to the dying until Trump was out? I mean, this whole Covid thing didn’t emerge yesterday and the vaccine isn’t news...]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[It’s as though this LPC can’t empathize w/ how others will interpret their words/actions. The “He/she experienced or will experience it differently than I” seems to hv permeated the party; add to that, “…&amp; I don’t care how they interpret it“ &amp; it almost seems like psychopathy. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The Cultural Revolution came a bit later: 62-76ish. That said, the 49-52 revolution events laid the groundwork for its spread leading to the 62-76 Cultural Rev. I would totally agree w/you: the events of the Cultural Revolution  mirror today’s new woke authoritarians‘ pursuits.]]></document>

But since they’re in a hospital bed posing as though they gave  birth to these two babies, I’m gonna go with a twist on another leftism: ‘birthing-person appropriation.’]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Irrelevant. This will get zero action. Times have changed. Today, if Biden shot someone in full view of witnesses on video in Times Square, somehow Trump would get the blame. That’s now where we’re at.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# PMO’s engaging in “systemic political interference” in our independent law enforcement agency. Maybe now it’ll be “quotas” to arrest racists to prove they exist, like his “admired” Mao who ‘corrected’ those who said there were no threats to the CCP, &amp; then set quotas to prove it.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My complaint isn’t about Trudeau; he didn’t just walk into the job. My complaint is with those who elected him. I might give them a pass for the 1st time they voted for him. But for those who voted for him twice &amp; thrice… AFTER serial blackface, AFTER misogyny, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Maybe we just need a go-to platform similar to National Newswatch except for any1 NOT already professionally affiliated with MSM to submit a story &amp; not get censored. It cud have an algorithm pushing the most liked stories to the top, but everyone gets to compete for readership.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Sheeesh, how? What am I missing here?! Is there, like, a PMO Meeting Request app or something? 🤔😄]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# At this rate we’ll be into Covid-26 before all Canadians get vaxxed for Covid-19. Kidding aside, I don’t doubt the possibility of “virus patches” for new strains &amp; a subscription plan(like for computers): paid subscription gets you “vax version upgrades” for Covid-20, 21, etc. 🤷🏻‍♂️]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It is fake. But interestingly MSM is reporting on it being on Facebook and RT’d on Twitter.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I’ve often thought same. If parties were abolished, they’d have no loyalty to a party leader, only to their constituents. &amp; they’d have to sit down w/ each other &amp; make mutual agreements supporting each other &amp; each other’s voters. No whipped votes; only voting per voter demands.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I suspect it won’t be a question of electricity demand. If Trudeau gets a Central Bank Digital Currency in place - &amp; manages to make it programmable - it’ll be about what the new currency will be programmed to allow you to buy. Yes,govt control over how you spend $. It’s coming.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A very good piece on the problem w/ #USER# . It’s from last February but still very accurate. You cannot win elections when you hibernate every 4 years.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# We need masks that let air escape out the bottom. My mask gets snug with under my jaw so the air gets trapped and ends up getting pushed up and fogs my glasses when I exhale. Sometimes I hold the bottom out to let air escape.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well, Trudeau said we have systemic racism, and Butts as principle secretary had great influence shaping all the systems in question. So maybe Trudeau was right: Canada has systemic racism.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He IS a racist. &amp; when he repeatedly raises race, he’s doing what all good Marxists do: antagonize the potential sources of differences/rifts between us. If 1 thing pisses off ppl like him, it’s that we listen to MLK: judge each other by character content, not skin colour. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This reflects their position leaning towards risk avoidance, not risk management. Basically “better to do nothing and compartmentalize all individuals“ rather than “let’s do the hard work and figure out what we can do &amp; how we can do it in a way that reduces risk.” #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[From the person who sole-sourced all her advice from the WHO arm of the Chinese Communist Party. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I feel alone s/times bc the rot that’s in their heads includes ideas like “Don’t listen to them! If you listen, you’re just as evil as them! Ridicule ANY source they cite! If they begin to make sense, belittle them, shame them! The prop of virtue will defeat reason every time!”]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It’s time to face the obvious: Covid-19 is a prototype of a bioweapon exfiltrated from a Wuhan lab likely by someone who wanted the resulting pandemic to tip off the world about what the CCP was up to. And Western scientists were afraid to say what it was for fear of ensuing war. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You wouldn’t. They’re publicizing this in case anyone tries to sue them. In court they can ask, “We made this list public; Did you consult your doctor about these  before taking the vaccine? No? Then it’s your fault!”]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It’s looking as though they don’t even care about getting caught anymore in another controversy. It’d just be another conflict of interest investigation, another report (“Trudeau 4.0”), another small fine, &amp; another election win thanks to the usual suspect constituencies.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I’m old enough to remember when visible minorities all fought to establish themselves as dignified, respectable, equal among all others. Now that they’ve achieved that, they’re each fighting to establish themselves as the most downtrodden, most oppressed, most disrespected.🤷🏻‍♂️]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Excellent write up. &amp; none of this was going on before Trudeau came along.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Trudeau’s objective has never been to help bring the developing world up to our standards because frankly he has zero economic clue where to begin.

		<document><![CDATA[With the trucker convoy still in place, Trudeau’s ego won’t let him back down on mandates. It’s no longer abt science.

		<document><![CDATA[It wud be great if this happened but I doubt it.

		<document><![CDATA[Precisely &amp; exactly. Trudeau’s mandates = no longer abt healthcare, since mandates everywhere (even globally) are dropping. He’s relying on outdated December info to justify his mandates &amp; not be seen as blinking first in his war on truckers. He can’t admit: truckers were right. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I read a book recommended by Dr Jordan Peterson - Ordinary Men by Christopher R. Browning.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# This is a fetish. He’s smart about it.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The LAST thing Trudeau &amp; other elites want is the carbon emissions problem solved &amp; carbon actually going down. They’d be horrified.

That’s their trick.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Exactly. Trudeau needed to protect Vance who was cooperatively throwing Mark Norman under the bus. Vance’s now roadkill.
