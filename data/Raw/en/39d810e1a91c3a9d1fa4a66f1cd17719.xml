		<document><![CDATA[Today's a new day and that means all of #HASHTAG# nation are #HASHTAG# fans as they take on the #HASHTAG#. #USER#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It's on, but I'm reading. I have a strong desire to see Boston out though. They didn't pay enough for 2018 cheating and don't deserve to go any further.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In these unsettled times, it's comforting to know some things never change. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I also read this morning that electing the governor from the opposing party to the POTUS is a historical thing in VA since Carter. It's likely a combination of all the things you've discussed, plus historical precedent.]]></document>

"The acknowledgment highlights how Twitter has been caught flat-footed by what it described in a statement as "a significant amount of coordinated and malicious" activity that led to "several errors" in Twitter's enforcement" #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They are the 10% at the right. I really think this started with their own complaints. But...proud boys, etc. glom on to it. I'm sure some of our favourite evil nations have given it a considerable boost too.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# 🥺🫂 I hope it passes quickly, Margaret. I'm so sorry.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That could be, too. Or, if you subscribe to the multi-verse, it's just one of many. I'm rather big on the idea of the universe as a penal colony for wayward souls.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Yes, mine will drive automatically if on a well-marked freeway -- even keep constant distance between cars. But, my hands have to be on the wheel and it's still a bit of a leap from my car to fully automatic. I'm counting on it for mobility downstream though... :)]]></document>
