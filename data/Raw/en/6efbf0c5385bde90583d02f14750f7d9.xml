		<document><![CDATA[#USER# We were forced to buy ( order) a ridiculous amount a few days ago bc it’s all they had available and we happen to be running low. We WILL be giving some of it away. And By “ridiculous amount” I mean ridiiiiccccullllous.  I’m talking way over 50 rolls.  Unreal!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[One of the people who came to look at the foster pups works at a local bakery, and mentioned they make vegan cupcakes, but not a lot of interest in them ( the town is full of ppl who like 2 “hunt”/ fish), so we showed interest the next day. They. Are. Absolutely. Amazing. Tasting #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I am replying 2 ur "my thing" post, giving perspective from some 1 who didn't stop eating animal parts bc they didn't like the taste, but from someone who turned away from it because they didn't want 2 support the needless harm done. All the taste, none of the cruelty. That's it.]]></document>

Thank You so much for sharing his life with us. He was loved, spoiled, cared for by an awesome human being.  You showed him that some people aren’t monsters.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# There is no intentional and needless harm done from eating a meat, cheese etc alternative. Most new vegans use those products as a stepping stone bc it's been driven in their brain since they were a child to eat animal parts. The plant based industry is blowing up, we r evolving.]]></document>
