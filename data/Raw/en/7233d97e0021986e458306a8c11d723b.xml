Instead we have people signing letters saying the virus was naturally occurring only later to find they were paying for research in the area where the initial outbreak occurred.]]></document>

Shouldn’t whistleblowers be protected #USER#?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I get your point, but 5 seconds is an eternity. How did the other events turn out and when were they?

Virtually every time I jumped in the pool to warm up my body hurt.  

Did I ever go 5 seconds slower than a few weeks before in a 200 no way.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Stop making an ass out of yourself.

I said nothing about any “group” only that people assume the worst from those they disagree with. 

In either case I will not bother to address you further you are banished from my feed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# If people who are vaccinated get less symptoms (coughing and sneezing) how on earth could they possibly have the same transmission? Makes no sense.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Honestly pretty dumb not to mention dangerous to be that drunk.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Not the same at all my friend:

1. Risk of ruin is way higher in poker tournament than having a bad snap somehow turn into a touchdown.

2. Raiders have a much better chance in second round with this decision. In a satellite winning the last hand does nothing for you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# And I’m sure you came from behind in the last 25 to win by two seconds. Also fastest to slowest in an entire season isn’t the metric. We’re talking a couple weeks. 5 seconds is an eternity. You’re right though this is totally fair to all the other competitors]]></document>

One year in the main facing a raise for most of my stack from #USER# I looked up #USER# and said “what would Norman do”? Next thing I knew all my chips were in the middle.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# People just regurgitate media headlines about what was said on the podcast. 

The media skews the reporting to fit their narrative.

In the end, I don’t give a crap what Fox, CNN, or Joe Rogan think I want the scientists to tell me why the scientist on Rogan is wrong.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# A friend of mine has a kid that has really bad vaccine reactions as a kid. As a result his doctor doesn’t want him vaccinated. His college denied his medical exemption even though it was signed by his doctor. That’s the type of thing I’m 100% against.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Kind of a sad comment on our media who runs with fake stuff like this all the time. Vast majority of people who oppose mask mandates don’t care and in fact would support your right to wear whatever you’d like. That’s their entire point.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# From the video it’s hard to come to either of your conclusions. 

That said, you definitely don’t have enough to call either of them a victim.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You aren’t a scum bag, and in the end this is on wsop. #USER# said something like bring on the AK. He was talking about CARDS not guns! Yet he’s banned for life. I really think you are a good guy, but if I made the call here I think a DQ from that event was appropriate.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# with paddles and fins on how many world records could you a retired swimmer break right now?

Now take them off, but swim as a female.

Hormones do NOT shrink hands and feet. Take what you want, for however long, but it will ever create a level playing field]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# If you have symptoms get tested and stay home until you get the results and are symptom free.

Wearing a mask won’t stop you from spreading covid. 

Covid is spread way more effectively by people who are coughing than those without symptoms.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# It’s long past time #USER#TD What #USER# is alleged to have said is highly disputed, wasn’t heard by a Caesars employee, and no worse than what #USER# said. In the end neither of them should be banned and certainly Sam has paid the price.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The vaccine seems to be safe for most. That said it’s important not to spread disinformation. 1. Vaccinated people can and do spread covid. 2. While making a fake vaccination card is criminal not being able to get the vaccine is more akin to a disability than being selfish.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I’m CEO of a software testing company we’d be a great fit and I’m willing to help.

My passion is our 6-12 grade tech programs. 

We do Microsoft Office Certifications (great for any career). I’ve been looking for something like this for kids headed into tech. Willing to help?]]></document>

I know he wants to take ownership of this and yeah he had things that could’ve been done better, but man come on the O line needs to take some responsibility here too.

I’m not saying Kris was favored, but delusional is thinking Sean couldn’t have lost that fight.]]></document>
