		<document><![CDATA[It is so much easier to talk back to nagging voices of victim-blaming when healthy remodelled scenarios become your new normal. Those voices slowly become intrusive thoughts that you can (semi-)peacefully shut down.

I wish every survivor robust community &amp; healthy remodelling 💞]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That in retrospect is such a concrete example to me of white women weaponising their tears against BIPOC. White women will literally shed tears to gain the upper hand, gaslight you, sic other white women on you &amp; weaponise white men against you to come to their damsel defense]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[P.S. here I'm not talking about the rare cases when people who are obviously part of hegemonic power in every way possible apply for asylum bc they "don't like it" (e.g. white cis USians sometimes do this bc they didn't like the election outcomes??) &amp; others point this out]]></document>

Fleeing war, violence &amp; the rubble of colonialism is absolutely a thing--so is going somewhere else for respite from the geolocalised epicentre of your bleeding traumas. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yup! While parts of decolonisation work for (neo)colonised people of colour can &amp; does involve the personal &amp; psychological (wrt unfucking the colonialism out of our minds &amp; bodies), decolonisation must primarily be the material process of ceding land, resources &amp; sovereignty. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Dutch health insurance is ridiculous. They're like ~~we're not capitalists~~ but then they make you pay 100+ euros/month for basic insurance AND you pay 250 euros/year for medication AND vaccinations aren't covered AND you need to pay for ER visits AND immigration-mandated tests]]></document>

I thought it might be circulation issues bc I saw blue veins on feet &amp; legs but docs don't think it's a DVT clot #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Seriously!!! And I'm pretty damn wary of white gays who gag for the drag on the fracking transphobe show

The only drag I've genuinely enjoyed has been the underground scene of queer trans BIPOC going back to its roots &amp; reclaiming it as a way to commit gender ~~transgressions~~ #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's crucial to be specific about layers of racism as they impact diff groups &amp; not always conflate experiences, but "BIPOC" isn't necessarily a bad term by itself, e.g. the umbrella term can be useful for racialised non-USians w/ complicated relationships to US race categories]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Refugee here (and not the UN quota kind--the fled-as-an-asylum-seeker kind). While they don't negate the horror &amp; trauma refugees have to endure, refugees &amp; children of immigrants absolutely have certain structural powers &amp; privileges that are inaccessible to undocumented folks. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We also need to contend with the heartbreaking reality that most trans folks who end up living long enough to be older tend to be white ppl who are citizens of the imperial core.

		<document><![CDATA[Also there are countless BlPOC trans folks compassionately exploring expansive ideas of queerness right now while firmly centring material consequences of moving through the world as you are with far more competence.

		<document><![CDATA[Fuck everyone who has ever served in the military for the imperial core (especially the US military). I don't care if y'all got pressured into it by poverty or racism--plenty of marginalised poor folks still don't resort to this. Lives outside the imperial core are devalued as is]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He also defended a WW when she compared joking about worms to systemic oppression of marginalised folks &amp; BIPOC called it out. I don't care for going after individuals in a world a system-based violence but this is a pattern--repeated centring of whiteness IS systemic violence. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[*"primary wielder" was awkward wording tbh, bc every white person is a primary wielder of whiteness. What I meant was that they aren't to be singled out as any worse re: wielding whiteness than other white trans folks.

		<document><![CDATA[**This isn't the only scenario where the voices of victim-blaming came up, but I think at some point it became easier for me to squash them wrt CSA bc I was a fucking child but still feeling like I "had some responsibility" when abuse &amp; SA happened to me as an adult]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Ok but can we also talk about how extra ridiculous this is on a uni campus (which is often an unregulated sex farm for cisheteros tbqh)? a provider I saw at the US uni I attended (also like Cornell) once asked me if I had casual sex &amp; that casual sex meant "sex w/o condoms" 💀💀]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Nah I'm done romanticising this. I'm more than happy to be friendly comrades w/ ppl I don't speak to for months, but I feel like ppl glorify being 'able to connect like no time passed' to justify taking others for granted &amp; doing nothing to nurture the relationship #URL#]]></document>

I'd be far less surprised by the ridiculous whining had I not directly experienced harm from yt trans folks countless times]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Block me if you think bringing up refugees, asylum seekers &amp; undocumented folks in your analysis of liberation is "academic fringe argument", or leave immigration-based oppression out of racial analysis :)) You're not fighting to liberate everyone &amp; I'm not in community with you]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I've talked about this before, but "validity is immaterial" is itself a position of privilege, &amp; I need y'all to think about this more.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# When Black &amp; brown survivors name our abusers (esp abusers who are "big" in leftist/activist circles), us coming forward is most often labelled as a "rumour". Your whiteness played a part in your initial dismissal &amp; calling it 'self-explanatory' when they raised this concern]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Lmao at mainstream trans 'activism' in Iceland that is primarily concerned with appeasing the cis &amp; pressuring all trans folks to play along for good reputation so that vague laws can get passed.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'm not either, but the grossest part is that many of these folks pulling the gotcha are literal lightskin mainlander POC 🙃

They definitely should understand, but of course they wilfully won't bc that would mean giving up power wrt colourism and systems of anti-Blackness 🤡]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Btw this is a horrific position to be in bcn1. They get deported if they don't look "flamboyantly queer enough" by fascist immigration standards BUTn2.

		<document><![CDATA[If you're really gonna skimp on masks, one way to retain efficacy is to (again, this isn't ideal) reuse a rotation of 3-4 disposable masks.

		<document><![CDATA[Oof, qrts are missing the point that many folks (esp poor white USians) position themselves as anti-capitalist not from a liberationist mindset, but rather out of self-centered annoyance at being poor.

		<document><![CDATA[It's interesting to witness the convenient moments (read: when it doesn't directly serve them or disrupts their white voice) when white folks will choose to "take a step back" for "self care" bc they are "setting boundaries".
