I've got nobody to go with.
I don't fancy my stoma going BRAAPPP at some moment.

I'm not afraid to speak out because I have the intelligence to understand the differences.
All we hear are deliberate misinterpretation's.
It's being used as a political weapon.

Very much under protest because my body is a Trainwreck &amp; my surgery advised.
Thought after the initial two, that's it, no more.
Schoolboy error.
I won't be having the booster as I've not been right since the first jabs.
My choice until full enforce.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #HASHTAG# is a marketable product like detergent.
Only this time round, it's harder to rebrand when people have buyer's remorse.
People are going to point at DC and declare "dare he tell us what we don't want to know".
Well the public have the right to.
And they are VERY angry!]]></document>

The 48" is a grand at Argos.
Perfect as a computer monitor too.]]></document>
