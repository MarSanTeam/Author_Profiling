		<document><![CDATA[Let’s be clear:

This was first promised 4 years ago. There’s STILL no proposal whatsoever.

After trying and failing to repeal ACA, the Trump admin is in court fighting to overturn the ACA and its preexisting condition coverage - with no backup plan. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Eventually this will land at SCOTUS. There’s a fair argument that it disenfranchises in-state voters.

If there’s a weakness in the current process, it’s so many states using winner-take-all. That functionally erases the EC votes of the losing side, regardless of party/state.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# “Worship of sports”? Why do you dislike free market choices of entertainment?

Major college sports are a profit center and/or source of scholarship funds at high profile programs. Why is eliminating that a good thing?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The issue is that it’s classic deflection. Republicans are trying to pivot the debate toward Schiff, or the political preference of the whistleblower or his attorney instead.

Schiff’s testimony has zero to do with the Q of whether Trump committed impeachable behavior.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Okay. Sounds like it should be easy to find a prosecutor or grand jury somewhere who agrees. Good luck.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# That may sound good, but in reality that’s not quite how it works. Higher courts do not review new evidence or hold new trials - they review processes and orders of lower courts.

SCOTUS reversing a twice dismissed lawsuit would be unheard of. We’ll see though...]]></document>

No one is talking about “legacy”. This is a thread about Biden’s qualifications and nepotism. Your comprehension, not my education, is the issue here.]]></document>
