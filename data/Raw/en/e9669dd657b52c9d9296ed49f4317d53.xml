		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# In my experience, it’s better to assume you’re definitely going to get pregnant or an STI and take precautions than roll the dice. The stakes are high and it only takes one “lucky” roll to win a life-changing jackpot. Better safe than sorry.]]></document>

It’s unreasonable to ask anyone to take that abuse for less than a livable wage, no benefits, weird ass schedules, and zero life balance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# In fact, there’s a verse in Jeremiah specifically forbidding the devout from chopping down tree and bringing them into the house for worship, as the pagans do. This is a very old tradition, but it was co-opted by the Christians from older religions. As usual, Tuck is ignorant. 🙄]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yep. My department has has a bumper year in volume and productivity since we started working remotely. Turns out people are more productive when we’re comfortable and don’t have to settle in after commuting 😊]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# If we acknowledge the uncomfortable truths of our past, white people might feel an obligation to do something to correct some of the lingering problems in our country. If we just deny it all, then white people can pretend nothing’s wrong and keep enjoying their privilege.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That’s just generally good advice, pandemic notwithstanding. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Me, too! I haven’t gotten a cold in almost three years cuz I always wear my mask in public and have been conscientious about using hand sanitizer after leaving every store. It’s really no trouble and I rather like not getting sick and feeling miserable 😊 I see no downside here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Sorry, can people just up and quit the military like it’s an office job? I thought they signed on for a set number of years and have to get discharged. 🤨]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I wonder if fish have alien abduction stories. “We were having lunch in the lake and suddenly, this huge shadow passes over us. Roy, he spots a great worm and when he caught it, he knew something wasn’t right. He rose straight up towards that shadow and was never seen again!”]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# *nods* It’s projection. 😊]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[How does an all-powerful being fear anything? In a universe of his own design, how does anything happen that he doesn’t want to happen? If god is unable to create a universe the excludes things he fears, how can we even call him a god? 🤨 #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# *nods* The opposite of humility is arrogance, declaring oneself to be the best without putting in the work; it’s entitlement. I only see confidence in these amazing women acknowledging the skills they put so much dedication into developing. We should celebrate confidence! 😊]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I’ve sKeats thought it’s so beautiful when a kid gets the space to figure things out on their own. It’s the purest kind of problem-solving and each kid had their own unique approach 😊]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I couldn’t agree more. Having an intimate piercing could not possibly affect her ability to be a good mom. That’s just asinine!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# And then, when corrected on it, double down HARD. There’s nothing wrong with making mistakes, we all do it and sure, it’s embarrassing, but own it, correct yourself, and move forward like an adult, FFS. It’s ok to say “I stand corrected and I learned a thing today. Thanks!”]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The AIDS vaccine that is scheduled to go into human trials in the next 5-10 years? Is it expected to have a time-traveling component giving it retroactive efficacy?? 🤨]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# And how systemic and implicit racism persists today. We must stop lying to ourselves about how perfect America is. America is flawed, it is not exceptional - but it can be improved and it can become exceptional! Only if we see it through clear eyes and invest in making it better.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yeah. We’ve been very sad all evening. It was just so sudden, no warning at all.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The irony is that he’s looking at capitalism at its purest. “There’s a demographic who don’t eat our product? Let’s come up with something to sell them so we can make more money!” As more people become vegetarian, offering options that appeal to them is just smart business.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# My point was that no matter how many atrocities the church permits and covers up, they are never held accountable because no politician dares to be seen doing anything than be construed as attacking the church. This is how they get away with murder, rapes, torture, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# And that was arguably due to diet. A nursing mother needs to make sure she’s consuming enough vitamins, fats, etc. to support quality milk production. Diet is still not fully understood, but people knew nothing about nutrition when wet nurses were common.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I felt this way when they kept explaining what Trump really meant with his world salads. These are people in high-stakes professional jobs and the ability to coherently articulate a point without needing a translator ought to be one of the basic skills they possess.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# If she had a physical problem that caused her to drop out, this wouldn’t even be a question. Mental health and wellness is just as important. It sucks that she had to drop out after coming so far, but I fully support her prioritizing her health over sport. She’s still the GOAT 😊]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[She was in Chicago urging people to get vaccinated so we can end this fucking pandemic. I rather think returning the country to normal as quickly as possible is a much bigger priority than pretending there’s a crisis at the border. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Vaccines have always been mandated for military service in this country, going all way back to George Washington issuing the first mandate for the Continental Army. And if you serve in the military, you follow orders or you get dishonorably discharged. That’s how it is!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# An abundance of unearned confidence untempered by education or self-awareness, mixed with cult-like tribal politics that spent decades convincing members to blindly follow the party in all things cuz everyone else is always lying, no matter what the facts say. Et viola!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Comedy is best when it speaks truth to power. Bashing on marginalized groups is the very opposite of that. Worse, it legitimizes prejudices that are used to persecute and oppress those groups, further robbing them of what little power they may have. It’s abusive in every way.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Oh, I plan to make a huge scene if someone tries that nonsense with me! If anything, weaving a tapestry of invective and profanity is more likely to keep the asshole there while we wait for the cops, cuz I plan to press all the charges!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# That’s what we did with our kids. Math is ultimately problem-solving and there are so many different ways to solve problems. IMO, learning different approaches puts a variety of tools in their mental toolbox to choose from 😊]]></document>
