		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Quite.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Yes, this. It's identical to the moral panic of the 80s to Lesbians and gay men being teachers or youth group leaders.

For decades, less than 5% of rapes reported to police have resulted in convictions. Being vastly under-reported, it's suggested only 1 in 200 women will see their rapists convicted. So yes, laws have limited impact. Education, prevention, cultural shift are essential.]]></document>
