		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Thanks.  Just read it. The whole thesis behind this article is the fake assumption that Chinese vaccines are useless compared to western vaccines apparently able to resist infection much better (really?).

The west prefers to bomb Muslims and invade their lands, while the Chinese try to re educate their own Muslims away from jihadist and backward Salafi ideology. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# So, basically within a matter of 3 weeks there were hardly any more new cases in my city and across China.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yeah, how could China and Wuhan allowed those missteps and coverups to happen, especially weeks AFTER Covids killed so many across cities Italy, France, Spain, UK and US.
