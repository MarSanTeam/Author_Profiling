		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The article just had 2 TV paid pundits saying this. The headline is a little misleading. It does confirm to me that the 2 party system is archaic and broke with this "don't give the opposition party a win" theory.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Fox News has 3 million viewers out of 340 million on a good night. Blaming them for anything but the right wing station sandwiched between 2 left wing stations is short sighted and simply not based in fact if you look at the numbers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Voting party line is the lazy persons way. Even when I was Voting for dems or repubs, I always split my ticket. Local elections are much more important than national. I wish you well my friend and peace. Stay safe.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I love when libs and conservs talk about the demise of the other party.  Although I personally would like to see the demise of both parties, historically the repups will gain power again next year.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Nice spin. I expected nothing more from dems and repubs. The point is dems and repubs have no problem voting against the debt ceiling when it suits them. Your feeble explanation is total BS. Sorry that goes over your 2 party cult head. Stay safe.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# One of the problems I have with you dems and repubs is that when your dude slips up, it's a Freudian slip and when the other party does it, it's what they really believe. These opinions keep you dems and repubs hating each other and aids in both party's erosion to independents.]]></document>
