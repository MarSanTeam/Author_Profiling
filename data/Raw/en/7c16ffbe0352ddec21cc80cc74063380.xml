We can retreat from woman and stay fast at female but soon that will fall too and the attacks on it started long before now.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Oh dear. Don't appropriate intersexed conditions to support trans dogma. Intersex isn't trans. 

Surgery cannot change a persons sex. 

So you don't have any evidence of people changing sex.]]></document>

It's taken me years to really start getting into conversations because the pile ons in my early attempts were horrible. 

I'd cut him some slack and maybe follow a few gc feminists.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# So in your mind, understanding that women exist directly means that transwomen do not? And vice versa. 

From those two options you choose to erase women for the benefit of those born male.]]></document>

I've now fainted because of this literal violence.

*faints*

See I'm actually on the floor now.

All fainted.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Ah but you'll find the malevolent ones *are* trans until they do something criminal and then they aren't trans. Unless nobody cares about the actual victims then trans become the true victims of a hateful society etc etc etc]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# This is true. Sometimes things just morph into the same problem with a different face, a worse problem or get better. It's mostly a roll of the dice I think as to which it will be.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It's interesting because they know damn well that people don't realise most transwomen are intact.

It took Helen an age to get one of the polling companies to take on the questionnaire because they all refused to touch it or wanted to change the wording so as to hide the meaning]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Surely all names are non-binary since expecting anyone to choose a name that fits into neither or both binary categories is forcing them to live as binary adjacent by using binary-normative expectations.nn#HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# This doesn't actually answer why you decided to push this topic on a threat about mn and childbirth. 

Anyhoo, how can women have autonomy if they must include males in everything? How do we equalise pay or increase female representation when males can be counted as female/women?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I think the point is that the only thing that could possibly make it through parliament is May's plan which very few actually want whether they be remainer or brexiteer. Something has to shift and a vote on one of 3 options is the most plausible.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Tbh the right thing would have been if when they realised DC had a specfic problem, recognised it and communicated to the public that this kind of action was reasonable so it could help other families.

But they didn't.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# No it's shouting and it makes your arguments look weak. 

If we are what we define ourselves to be I suggest you tell girls who would like an education or to not sit in huts when on their period or child brides to define out of that situation. Will that work do you think?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# That was the thing that jumped out at me from the Nolan investigation.

One side couldn't even discuss its own terminology and got confused.

The other was clear, concise and could back up points with either evidence or explanation.

I bet you can't guess which was which 🤣]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# If they were truly women, people in power wouldn't be paying any attention.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# No I'm not. They are no threat to me and can use the men's. Women's toilets are there for a reason. Lesbians being challenged in female spaces is a result of Gen ID telling women that no space is safe and that they must be on their guard.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Yes but it's the evidence that I'm questioning here. Where has it come from? How robust is it? I've seen some very big claims made by people who couldn't back it up. 

Downplaying isn't helpful but overstating can be very dangerous with regards to suicide.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yes they have a certain function which they will never have if they are created for a transwoman. It may help them to feel better but they are not the same. A birth certificate is not produce by doctors. What do you think doctors use to identify a male or female baby?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Yes. I'm being very England centric 😉

Bizarrely, now that I'm thinking about it, for me

The North = North of Yorkshire upwards + Scotland

Ooop North = North of England

I appreciate that's probably only true in my brain 😁😂]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# They have zero problem because they've thrown women under the bus for woke cookies. 

I know it's hard not centering males in literally everything but for sake of women and girls we need to have a movement that's just about us.]]></document>
