		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Inflation is primarily driven by global influences. The NZD, like every other global currency, reacts to the US economy. This is why when the US Stockmarket collapsed it rippled around the World, and why every US recession has triggered a global one. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Investigate Oligarch influence &amp; dark money on US politics. Enact laws that tighten regulations around campaign revenue &amp; foreign donations/influence.

I remember exploring the bush on Mt Pihanga over 40 yes ago with my dad &amp; siblings &amp; finding some massive trenches that Maori used to evade the British by quite literally walking below ground level. They were able to hit and run pretty much with impunity. #HASHTAG#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# After living through &amp; observing both the Key era and this Govt, as a lay person looking at the social media it is obvious that the abuse of Ardern is unprecedented yet here you are denying and minimising. Why? Anyone with a strong moral compass would be denouncing it. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# While we are at it what did YOU do about it?  Did you lay a broadcasting complaint?  Did you write a letter to whichever papers published it?  Did you start a go fund me and then print a counter argument advertisement?
Or did you, like a child, blame the PM?

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# It passed the threshold of experimentation in the first few months. Your ignorance is astounding. I never lost any basic human rights dude. You should educate yourself on what they are before spouting your brainwashed nonsense. I feel sorry for you.]]></document>

Colour me surprised.]]></document>

As per my question, where are they going to put more beds?  Where will the staff come from?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Lmfao IKR? Meanwhile we keep inventing technology that they then use.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# What I also challenged you on was the implied statements that Te Reo Maori is not a living language, by calling transliterations fake. Your tweets have actually shown your own entrenched unconscious bias. For example telling me not to speak about English when challenged.]]></document>

You demand I not comment on a thread while commenting on a thread. That is literally the point of Twitter. 
You call me names because you can’t control yourself. Smdh.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Oh please. You don’t give a rat’s arse about saving lives. If you did you would help sort out the ignorant belief that 2A means unfettered access to firearms &amp; support common sense guns laws.
You don’t because you’re a hypocrite just like the rest of your corrupt party.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# No, you were spinning the truth to imply the Government won’t disclose this to the public which is blatant rubbish. As with other absconded from isolation they don’t comment on an active police matter but have always disclosed. You’re being disingenuous.]]></document>

Now do transmission gully and how much it has cost tax payers to finish that National project… oh… wait… it’s still not finished. #HASHTAG# Your party’s one note solution is more roads.

Again, who was talking about Ardern?
Stay on topic if you can ok? #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Don’t be ridiculous. The Ministry of Health is a neutral Government agency that doesn’t operate from a political ideology but carries on regardless of which party is in Government. To suggest anything different is conspiracy theory nonsense.]]></document>

The food poisoning may well be part of the story. You don’t know. The question was asked and you literally lost your shit.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# It is clear from your tweets you do not understand the science as you are incorrectly ascribing the total eradication of covid to the term elimination, which, in the case of a zero covid strategy does not mean eradication forever. 
Educate yourself.]]></document>

Nothing this woman tweeted is accurate but sure, be insulting about the leader of a country with the best covid response instead of questioning the fact free take you’re all in on.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Dude, she worked in a fish and chip shop while in school. Many NZ students had similar jobs. It’s not shameful, in fact the polar opposite as it shows a willingness to pay her own way. Your lack of maturity over it however is something you should be embarrassed about. Grow up.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I’m totally stunned that you’re this uninformed. What are you agreeing with exactly?  Nothing in his ridiculous column is accurate. 
Maybe worry about your own plague nation and the idiot that is Boris Johnson. We’re doing fine without your fact free reckons.]]></document>
