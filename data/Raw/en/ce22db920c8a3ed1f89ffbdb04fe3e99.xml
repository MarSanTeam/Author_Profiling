However, since it's not going to be solved quickly, there needs to be a solution that doesnt put women and girls at risk.

Also, I don't think being transgender is an excuse or a lie in many, many cases. I think those people are served with hormones and/or surgery.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Is that all you have to hang your hat on the greatness of Walmart? 

I do believe the giving started as a result of their terrible press about how they treat their employees. I'm glad if this corporation has worked for you, but that doesn't make it saintly.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# All pregnant people are female. All adult human females are women and nobody else. As a biologist, I know this.]]></document>
