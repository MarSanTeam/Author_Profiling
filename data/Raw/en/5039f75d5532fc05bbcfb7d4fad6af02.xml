No gods have been demonstrated to exist, and believers make fools of themselves when they try to argue for one. Not believing in them is the easiest thing in the world.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I mean, there is a *slight* point in mentioning that religious belief is a learned behavior. But then that begs the question ... how did the first theism arise if it's a learned behavior?

I don't see it as very useful.]]></document>

They also cited their Bible as justification to keep slavery.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It tries to hijack everything, all without any merit whatsoever. Morality, altruism, family, reason ... fuck, I just saw yet another thread of someone trying to claim science itself as Christian. I've seen them try to claim evidence and reason as solely theirs.

Shit's foul.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I disagree. When someone immediately flips to "you should show me respect, and I would smack you if this convo were in real life", that's an emotional reaction someone makes when backed into a corner. He wants to make it physical because he knows he can't win in the mental realm.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Then we have a lot of common ground.

An issue I have is that religion compounds social/moral issues unnecessarily by clouding them in the religious language and ideas, drawing people away from more realistic responses and solutions. In some cases, it creates the problem itself.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'm soooooo sick of hearing twats make this argument. It's essentially just an attempted character assassination, and derails the convo away from the important point - whether or not there's any good reason for believing in any god.

A red herring, as someone else pointed out.]]></document>

Man, this is so much like the racism discussions in America.]]></document>

I laid out multiple refutations of your claims. You ignored me for two days, then came back and said you were ignoring everyone else because you didn't think we were serious.

You sowed insult, and so you reap insult.]]></document>
