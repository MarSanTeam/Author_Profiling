		<document><![CDATA[I am amazed at the number of Arabs, especially #HASHTAG#, who do not believe the story of the 6 Palestinians escaped from #HASHTAG# jail.
That sums up how #HASHTAG# is embedded in our psyche!
Pure mental weakness btw!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[The Islamist dude also claim that Egyptian MPs from Upper Egypt were appointed to support the future Coptic State.

I, for one, happy to walk in torrential rain, but not contribute to #HASHTAG#’s wealth.

		<document><![CDATA[I think it is disgusting to taunt people for supporting their National team. 
I never mocked a French who support France or Dutch for supporting Netherlands, but somehow some think it is ok to mock the English for supporting #HASHTAG#.

Enjoy your stupid anti-🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿hatred dudes!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Watching top notch pundits going out of their way to defend #HASHTAG#; downplay impacts of #HASHTAG#, 
like third-world “Yes Sir” bunch, is truly heartbreaking

They remind me with Nasser’s PR guy #HASHTAG# when he described 67 defeat as just a “Naksa-setback”

		<document><![CDATA[How cute!

“The hunt for Salbi has extended to #HASHTAG# where his brother,Adel Salbi, is representative in a political party called Turkmen Iraqi Front. The new #HASHTAG# leader thought to have maintained connections with his brother until he was named as leader”

		<document><![CDATA[Let me refresh #USER# memory.
In 9/11, Mullah Omar was the face of evil.
Now his son, Mohammad Yaqoob, is a top leader of Taliban-a group that was in “disarray” in May 2020, according to FP report

Biden has provided a divided weak group a kiss of life!

		<document><![CDATA[Sorry to be politically incorrect.
#HASHTAG# independence is one of darkest days in history! Islam is a faith; not a national identity 
Despite the best intentions, Islamism has plaqued #HASHTAG# after, and current backing of #HASHTAG# is a clear example.

		<document><![CDATA[I really hope #HASHTAG# will not give the drowning Sultan a life line and not buy his charm offensive.
He is desperate to increase Turkish exports to the Kingdom, after it plummeted last year, to save his economy!

		<document><![CDATA[There are two camps who are behind faux outrage against the movie:
