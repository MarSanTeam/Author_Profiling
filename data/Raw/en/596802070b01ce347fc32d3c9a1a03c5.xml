		<document><![CDATA[Got a horrible message from a Twitter user tonight saying I was a "Cartoon Avatar" and "Nothing I said had any meaning &amp; nobody cared". I did a quick google search and he was right...not one image of me beyond the first 4 pages. My Flickr stats too, only 7.3million😥 #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[See...same colour...it's like an icky 1950s industrial greenish aqua.
I'd expect to see it on a non-dyson handheld vacuum! #URL#]]></document>

Front end looks strange like it's from something else entirely....and the loading area looks sunken!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# It was a terrible joke on a topic that routinely gets attacked by trolls in exactly the same way! A lesson to everyone use tags!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA["You don't have Spotify?, you buy CDs?...how backward are you😄" Backward enough to pick the tunes I want, rip, resample, expand and play over bluetooth sound systems that make people weep with joy. But please, continue telling me how much of a luddite I am for not renting music. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# *sigh*
Covid19 is a self-assembled nano particle...but antennae with decent range weren't high on the to-do list.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Ooooh I dunno....just 2 hours of her would have done! #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# *sigh*
Another person not understanding the problem.
In real life, people aren't being listened to by millions...that carries a responsibility few are prepared for.
And in real life...you make a mistake...nobody notices.
On his show...half a continent gets disinformed.]]></document>

Only I hope they get more resources this time.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I've taken to adding tags as it doesn't come across and everyone takes it as something it's not! Imagine someone quote tweeting or screenshotting it to throw at you weeks from now. ...any attempt at explaining taken as fumbling/making excuses.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# God...damn...clear the deck &amp; close the hatch!😱]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well, I began with a Sega Mega Drive, then a Saturn when they came out...but due to living in regional Australia and having no distribution, the more popular playstation was all that remained in the market...so I abandoned consoles for PC.
Then Xbox, 360, One and Series X]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The f**k are you even saying with this huh?
Really?
What do we do with it?
Tell the rest of the world f**k off?
Sort your own s**t out?
Did you think it was clever?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'm sure that sounded like a gotcha &amp; really clever in your head, but like all straw man arguments you do it wrong on purpose so you can moan about "how wrong it is".
Pineapple is used only sparingly on pizzas that call for it, and even then there is only 2 varieties I know. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Also any ear, eye and respiratory protection you can manage.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In the wake of #HASHTAG# telling people to "engage" with the idiots in life who will...never...listen...I'd remind you it's not your job, you're under no obligation to "hear them out"...and they'll just blame you for being the way they are no matter what you do!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# May want to show them some casualty vids first. Men missing jaws, eyes still open, dogs eating the soft tissues above the uniform collar, limbs laying in the street with no apparent owner. War isn't call of duty, and humans are very fragile.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Imagine if another comes along later, with an actually important topic...and people tune out "yeah we did this dance before". I mean I've warned Schindler before, this was right up my alley. To debunk something on my special topic😑 #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Took the jibe tonight "Hey you should send them some of your surplus gas masks". While I do have a few, I threw away the cans. They have dates printed, some date back to 1991...all would have expired, none would meet any security standard and russians aren't using gas in Ukraine #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# They really enjoy having a role given to them rather than making one. Guide their famous game's famous character through environments for drama &amp; storytelling. They really want to make films, but they'd be laughed out of every theater if they did.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well you know how there was always that one child in 3rd grade who said their favorite food was meat &amp; 3 veg so the teacher would give them praise for being "mature"...when you KNEW they enjoyed 3 square raw cookie doughs a day? People pretend to "love a challenge".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Do they know there is no viable alternative to youtube?
Owning discs was always a viable alternative to spotify.
Or did we get so caught up in the onward march we forgot?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[As good a time as any to say out loud I HATE the stitching detail on these pockets.
It's rough as anything and rubs against the polyurethane coating inside each pocket &amp; makes holes as the material de-laminates. #URL#]]></document>
