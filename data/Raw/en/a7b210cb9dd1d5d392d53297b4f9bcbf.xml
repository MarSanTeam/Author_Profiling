		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Uhhh ... there is a DOJ policy that rules out indicting a sitting president. That's why Trump was called Individual-1 instead of a co-defendant when Cohen was charged with the illegal payoffs to Stormy and Karen, for which Cohen served time. Surprised you didn't know this.]]></document>
