		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I understand and I can relate. Why is it so hard to have interracial couples w two brown people? Like? I really think studios just want to find a way to keep whiteness centered. So they'll give us lightskin POC/ambiguous representation but ALWAYS compassed against white ppl]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I feel like a broken record. I don't like the fans tht are #HASHTAG# antis. So many comments abt the non binary/trans characters and "I miss the old show" ok? So go watch it. Or pretending Charlotte wasn't ignorant and sheltered. She literally calls herself a WASP.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I like tht Sydney Sweeney got to showcase her range and not just her breasts. The sex scenes were beautifully shot and not lingering on her nude. But interestingly they specifically shot around Elordi so as not to show his butt. Just don't show anyone nude then. #HASHTAG#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It's weird. But I do think Black Adams proves intriguing. I do wish they had proper ethnic and cultural representation from behind to infront of the screen. Dwayne/Rock being a fan of the material doesn't justify tht. Looking vs Being!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If Scream 4 was released later it would've been obvious and heavy handed as a social commentary on internet fame/and influencer culture...for whatever magical reason...it is so striking watching it 10 years on and seeing EVERYTHING come true.

		<document><![CDATA[I love that the finale of Halloween H2O and Scream 3 take place in the same house...the legacy. 
Omg Selma Blair was considered for Jennifer Jolie? I could see it. But I wish she was Angelina instead so we'd have her and Parker interact. Why did Alicia Silverstone turn it down?:(]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I don't think this is a lesson tht even near white passing or lightskin, mixed biracial people are "still Black" ..but tht some people can willingly choose to benefit from an oppressive, racist, imperialist structure and even when they experience the lows of it, protect it.

		<document><![CDATA[I kinda feel like you should just leave the season as it is without removing already planned or shot scenes. But I understand Noth is now an issue- but I hope it doesn't have an effect on plot. Perhaps this opens up a finale spot for a Cattrall zoom call cameo? #HASHTAG#]]></document>

Cringe.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Shoutout to Eternals for having a Black/Arab gay couple. Too many white interracial couples I feel these days. It was refreshing to see a big, Black man and a lebanese man in heart warming love. That kiss. Yes! #HASHTAG#]]></document>
