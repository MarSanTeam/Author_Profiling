		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My reasoning is bc I’m a tomboy and huge heavy rings are just not me at all. I’d wear this every day bc it wouldn’t snag on things or bother me since it’s so light. A big ring would 100% end up sitting in a jewelry box and worn on special occasions]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I’m multitasking so I’m sorry if my replies came off as harsh, not my intention.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Lol that’s funny. 2 totally diff paths. For me, rock was dead after Soundgarden &amp; Audioslave were over (2 diff periods 90s/2000s) and by then I was almost exclusively listening to hip hop.
