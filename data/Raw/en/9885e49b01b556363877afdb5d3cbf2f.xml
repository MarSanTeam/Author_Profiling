Given those options, Jews didn't have much choice but to marry other Jews and low population numbers meant reduced options.]]></document>

I know it might not seem political, but I remember being scared to go to school for weeks afterward because of the wall-to-wall coverage. I was 9.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Look. The reason the Cherokee, etc. were called the Five Civilized Tribes is because of the ease they adopted "white" ways with. They even owned Black slaves and took their slaves with them when they were displaced on the Trail of Tears.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# No one claimed you said all Jews were bad. "Many" and "alot" were your words of choice. You've done everything from citing a handful of individual Jews to bringing up Jewish slave owners (a minority) to bolster that claim.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# A lot.

They don't say the exact phrase, but sentiments like "We must take a stand against antisemitism, Islamophobia, and all forms of bigotry" are basically the same sentiment. They can't condemn antisemitism without piggybacking it on something else.]]></document>

Or if the daughter IS going to survive, at the very least, not have her under mind control. Make fighting Black Widow a voluntary choice driven by revenge.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Just because Jewish racism against Black goyim doesn't turn violent doesn't mean it lacks impact.

		<document><![CDATA[The government of Poland wouldn't let them in, as a law passed that year had annulled the passports of Jews who'd been living outside the country.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Yes and no.
