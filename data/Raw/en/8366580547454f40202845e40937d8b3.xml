		<document><![CDATA[The quieter he is, the more his team gets to scheme something sinister without scrutiny on them. It is also problematic because some of the best barometers of MAGAt world were banned in the purge as well, so it's hard for me to gauge what they are up to now.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Based on some of the support I have seen from the rank and file, and based on the long history of white supremacist infiltration in the ranks, it would not surprise me at all if Tr*mp can get them to pull off a military coup for him. He doesn't need the joint chiefs of staff.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #URL# Not even a remotely accurate story. There were arrests on Saturday and the brutality was completely uncalled for. This reads like #HASHTAG#.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[What I will say is that you should expect to see more resignations and firings this weekend, as Tr*mp clears out the whole government and installs loyalists into position of power that can forcibly support his coup efforts in the bureaucracy in government.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# As for the 6th, it's really hard to say, though I've been monitoring a number of developments. Tr*mp's ability to pull off a congressional coup is gone since McCarthy lost the speaker election, though it was very close, Pelosi won by just two votes.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[They may have been working off the assumption that the left is disorganized and bruised, but the reality is entirely the opposite. The left, like the fascists, being shut out of the political process, will begin mobilizing in ways that are designed to disrupt the system.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My city is soft. It's that simple. Last summer was unprecedented because that uprising was unlike anything we had ever seen before. The police instigated it with the brutal mass arrests at the Barclays Center. It's probably going to take something like that to change things.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# While they should have occupied Gracie Mansion and the park that surrounds it, they are occupying City Hall as we speak. They naively believe they can get you to #HASHTAG#. I know you won't, so I'll say what I've said for months now: resign.  #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Why? So we can have another council member who refuses to #HASHTAG#? You should try to get your money back and put it with a candidate who won't have Pat Lynch's endorsement by next year. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The point is that there are a lot of unknown variables at play here and there is no certainty as to how to vote is going to go.

		<document><![CDATA[It’s also no coincidence that the director of national intelligence keeps hinting about Chinese influence in the elections. This is being done to lay the groundwork for something sinister in the next week or two. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Not letting any legislation get enacted works in his favor because eviction moratoriums and unemployment insurance would end suddenly, sending millions more Americans into poverty and homelessness. Making people desperate to survive plays to his advantage.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Trust me. #USER# and the slimy #USER# are going to cave. They have thoroughly discredited themselves after refusing to #HASHTAG# despite protestor demands. Their day of reckoning is coming.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This might have something to do with why they aren't going through with impeachment, but of course this could also be because elitist #USER# begged a congresswoman who still may have had COVID to go to DC to vote for her for speaker. 🤡 show. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The point is that the MAGAts have been trying to orchestrate a coup for Tr*mp for the last two months and if they fail, they will become disillusioned with the electoral system. You couple that in with disillusionment from the left and the ruling class has a recipe for disaster.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Really classy having your cops say we "should all die a slow death." #HASHTAG#  #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Please help push for this vote of no confidence. It will ramp up the pressure on de Blasio to resign if the council votes for it. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So direct it to the person I was tweeting at, who works for Brad Lander, if you are serious about holding them accountable. 

We will have to agree to disagree, especially since I already made my case as to why Tiffany Caban is not serious about changing anything.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They also called Officer Anus a "good cop" on the day this happened. "Profound reformer" my ass. #USER# #USER# needs to resign now. #USER#, send the message immediately. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Pompeo is one of the last Tr*mp officials still in the cabinet and he does not plan to resign until Wednesday. That matters in the event of a military coup because he's in the line of succession should things go haywire. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Tr*mp is absolutely counting on them not taking him seriously, so that they aren't preparing to deal with it when he begins to make the more aggressive moves towards executing his fascist coup. We should be prepared to respond when the liberals are caught off guard.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So I will continue to watch this because most people aren't. Tr*mp may have faced many setbacks, but the larger moves seem to be going exactly as they should be for his coup attempt to succeed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# But he also met with de Blasio the other day as part of the mayor's last ditch attempt to save himself from being forced to resign. Beckford's not really being upfront about why he was invited to the meeting and what was said. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Go fuck yourself. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They are certainly going to try. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So the plane attack I was worried about was a false alarm. It just landed safely. Still, this day has been unprecedented in American history.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Gee, #USER# #USER#, it's almost as if your boss #USER# is not going to be able to stop the onslaught of negative stories coming out against him and his corrupt policies. Perhaps he should resign now before he's indicted in criminal court.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Why aren’t you calling for #USER# #USER#’s resignation? #HASHTAG#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[It's not just politicians on the "left" doing this. Politicians on the reich are doing it too. They are trying to crush dissent, first through intimidation and harassment and then through violence. This is not going to end until we make it end.  #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Are you going to refuse to certify a budget that doesn't #HASHTAG#? #USER# said they need your signature for it go through. Will you refuse to give it? The people at #HASHTAG# want to know. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You might want to work on getting this tweet getting taken down for a copyright violation. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Seriously watch the videos in this thread. Tr*mp's fascist sycophants are riling up the Proud Boys and other nazi groups to violence in DC today. This is endorsed at the top, no matter how much they'll try to deny it later. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I didn't even realize that there was an action tonight. Shows how completely ineffective their tactics are. Maybe they should try burning things again. People will pay attention then.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The march on Gracie Mansion tomorrow will be fantastic because you won't be able to avoid the crowds of tens, maybe even hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers yelling "Resign!" in unison.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh my God! The horror! Dirt bikes! Such a travesty! A sign of disorder in our streets going unpunished!!!!! #HASHTAG# Seriously, though, this is the type of whipped up hysteria that the fascists over at the Compost foment and which our shitty lawmakers take seriously. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[When the 🐷s go totally hog wild on protestors like they did tonight on the Brooklyn Bridge, the solution is not to allow peace police, like a certain live streamer on the scene named Sophie Sosa, to be deescalating, especially after brutal beatings and pepper spray being used.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Which is why I've said McCarthy winning is not such an unrealistic scenario and that's why I've kept asking what the plan is if he wins.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Resign. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I mentioned how there were elements of the left that wanted her out for not being progressive (which is true, she is an elitist) and also that there were problems stemming from Covid keeping people home. Now, members of the Biden liberal camp want her out as well. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Thank you, Ari. Also please call for #USER# #USER# to resign. He's literally killing people as we speak. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Also, I would never suggest non-combatant employees strike on their own. Strikes work when large groups of people engage in them. The military would have a hard time penalizing thousands of people striking at the same time. It would cause mutiny, which is the desired goal.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also if Tr*mp's next move is demanding that corrupt Leticia James drop her investigation into his business dealings, then he's not going to publicly announce it. It would be something quietly worked on behind the scenes, which we may only get glimpses of from leaks in the press.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh wow the fascists are sending a dueling slate of electors to congress and it didn't even get rubber stamped by a single reich wing legislature. That's just really brazen...and also shows that they are going to take this all the way to the end.  #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Absolutely, it's a big problem and it's a big problem with the union leadership as well. This is where black teachers are going to need to be leading the front lines: both on forcing a strike and addressing racism in the ranks. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# This isn't good enough. All that this is is a hiring freeze and a push for retirements, which still bloats the budget via pensions. Where are the layoffs? 50-A is repealed now. Go through the CCRB archive and layoff officers with several or severe substainated complaints.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It's only changed minds recently. Up until this point, lawmakers were still big bootlickers after getting beaten up by the 🐷s. Case in point: Jumaanee Williams. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Please try to figure out where de Blasio is dining out tonight so he can be told to fuck off and resign in person. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# She was friends with Roger Ailes too. He even wrote the foreword to one of her books. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I really hope #USER# and #USER# see this because they were already trying to get a hashtag going to "stand" with Freeland a few days ago. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Thanks for sharing this. Also let #USER# know about this because he wants to repeal the recently passed chokehold law to allow the NYPD to choke more black people to death. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# How long do you expect your boss #USER# to avoid speaking to the press about his scandals? As I've said before, they are continuing to come out and they are not going away. Resign or face jail time for covering up murder.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So naturally, this would be the home for the Proud Boys and other fascists groups to organize another coup attempt before January 20th. The site is wonky now, but once it stabilizes, I will monitor it closely to see what's happening. Hopefully this breakthrough is clarifying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'm keeping an eye on both the militant options he has been weighing recently and this last ditch effort to overthrow the results in congress. I will post updates when he has chosen a plan and whether it's something we should be worried about or if we're safe to move on.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Send the message along to your boss, #USER# #USER#, that protecting de Blasio from being forced to resign and opposing layoffs in the NYPD is a one way ticket to ending his political future.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Preferably, an uprising and an overthrow to establish a new form of governance that works for everyone, but the people aren't ready yet. They will be eventually when the full face of our wicked system reveals itself. It just isn't right this second.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'm getting eerie vibes from your tweet because of this. I really hope Tr*mp doesn't try to go all faux populist to lure desperate, impoverished people into supporting a coup. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Are you not aware of what's happening here? #USER# laid this out months ago and it's going according to plan. These "voter fraud" claims are part of a calculated campaign to disregard the election results. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# And? People are breaking into people's houses and threatening lawmakers. If you want the rage to be channelled in a non violent, but more aggressive way, this is it. Otherwise, what's about go down will be even worse than the rioting we've seen across the country.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Gee, I wonder why that might be? #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# While this is going on, #USER# #USER#'s new press secretary, #USER#, is insulting people on Twitter. This is the level of incompetence in his administration. He needs to be forced to resign right now.  #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# He could resign and make way for someone else to take charge, but he refuses to do that. Every day he insists on hanging on is another day he is complicit in everything the NYPD does. Stop defending someone who deserves no defense.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Thomas is an outright fascist, while Roberts is an "institutionalist," even if he's also a fascist (the "respectable" kind).

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Very much so. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Riots? That's mild in comparison to what will actually happen. It'll provoke secession in GOP held states and start a civil war, which Tr*mp will provoke from exile.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It's an unhappy Father's Day because your pigs nearly choked someone to death and you still refuse to resign. Get out of Gracie Mansion right now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Two things: 1) I guarantee you that this war criminal will be booted out by the end of the month. Probably one of the last figures to be forced out before the coup ramps up, but he'll be sidelined since he's clearly not on board with the reich. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You all have been given weeks to remove #USER# #USER# from office to give our city a fresh start. Now that it seems obvious that you and the rest of the council will not be doing that, the claws are going to come out for all of you. Good luck. 😉 #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Because that's his public position and, from all indications, it's his private one as well. If he isn't forced to resign, then he's going to hold firm and they won't cut the budget. His resignation is necessary to defund the NYPD. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Don't go at it alone. Team up with the other city union workers and push a #HASHTAG#.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also what makes this the likely home of Tr*mp's final coup messaging is that, unlike Parler, which relied upon corporate Amazon servers to run its website, Gab has its own servers, so they can't be shut down so easily. There could be DDS attacks, but that's about it. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Not to mention the propaganda win for Tr*mp that tens of thousands of deplorable people "peacefully" showed up to support his illegitimate claims of "voter fraud" and a "rigged election," which furthers the narrative to his base and makes his coup attempt more likely to succeed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We needed to have a bigger counter protest showing up in the morning, but liberals, with their idiotic, fucking stupid pancake memes made that impossible. This was kind of the worst case scenario, but at least the comrades in DC went toe to toe with the Nazis.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# has continued to get slapped in the face by you again and again. It's long past time for you to resign. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# He still faces criminal prosecution in New York, even though the chances of facing federal charges now are slim to none. He hasn't made this probe go away, so I'm concerned he'll do something desperate soon as a last ditch effort. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Personally I don't think they are going to hear it, but I'm not entirely sure because I wonder what the fascist justices are thinking about the "court packing" talk. We should know soon what their decision is going to be, but the fact that they haven't made a decision yet is bad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# We haven't heard from Monahan this morning. It's also possible that de Blasio shamelessly tried to beg them not to resign in the interim of yesterday to today, hence his even more egregious boot licking this morning. Those rumors didn't come from nowhere.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The media may think that publicly revealing this will help shame them into condemning Tr*mp's coup attempt, but what it will actually do is make the fascists see this is a target list of "RINOS" to intimidate and threaten. Great job, media! #HASHTAG# #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[As I've stated many times before, the level of poverty caused by this pandemic and the fascist response to it by our government, in the form of a genocidal "back to work" policy, has been so severe, it's creating a major snap amongst the general public.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Fair enough (though you should know that the NYPD's public leaks of mugshots are legally questionable), but that doesn't take away from the larger point. Get the info on the arresting officers. People shouldn't have to wait until December to know. We are entitled to know now.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Are people on the left aware that these people are part of the enemy we are fighting against? If Tr*mp is actually  forced to leave on the 20th, everyone has to start aiming their fire at these liberals and just attacking non stop. They do not get to control the narrative now.]]></document>
