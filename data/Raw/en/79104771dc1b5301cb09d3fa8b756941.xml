I'm perfectly okay with any artist saying, "I don't discuss politics." In fact, I'd admire them even more for taking a stand and not mixing politics and art.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yeah, I am pansexual...I can relate to this. There is a lot of discrimination BOTH from the straight and sometimes the LGBTQ+ community too. Funny thing, the issues are always on their end, not mine. I'm good with who I am! 🙂👍🌈 #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yeah....of course "Love thy neighbor unless he is gay, has another religion, votes for someone else, or believes in adults having the freedom to do what they damn want" HAHAHAHAHAHA!

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# 😂👍 I agree! If it's MMA or Boxing and they're shirtless, hot and inked up, then I'll watch a sport. My ex BF did MMA, so I understand the rules. He had to buy jockstraps for an actual sport...I was like: 🤤😍🍑😂 #HASHTAG#]]></document>

1) Joe doesn't rock a tan suit. The color washes him out. Also, he's a slim guy and doesn't need triple buttons

2) Great fit. Great colors. One button. Great choice!

3) Black suit. Slate blue tie. Looks good.

4) Perfect color! 10/10 #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I like a nice, basic cornbread stuffing with rosemary, sage, celery, onion, parsley, etc. I can handle if it's got walnuts and cranberries but I'm not too big on other additions to stuffing. Then, it just becomes another dish.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA["Carrie" was a brilliant example of a villain/hero. On the one hand, we feel sympathy for her. On the other hand, she's a very scary and powerful person to those who have wronged her. Carrie is a very conflicted character. We're both happy and sad for her by the end.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Client thought her hair would turn "rose gold" because that's the color it said on the box. She already had brown hair with red/violet color in it. Rose gold is yellow/red based. If you add pink and yellow to red, you get FLAMING ROAD CONE ORANGE, not rose gold! ❤️➕💛 = 🧡🔥👩‍🦰🤦‍♀️]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Omg...His ABS! 😍🤤 I'm liking the blond hair color too. His stylist did a good job toning it. Not yellow, not orange, not fried. Nice color balance. Of course, it helps that he's also got nice thick, youthful hair that is hard to damage... 😂👍 #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yikes! I had that happen with a Dr Pepper once. It was a mess. Frozen Dr Pepper on everything. The best remedy, just rinse/wipe off whatever is in a package, remove all the food, then wipe the inside of the freezer with a hot towel.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Good for you for reporting him! Must have been quite a fail if he's denying ever having modeling work.

		<document><![CDATA[As a stylist, I have an opinion on this #HASHTAG# stupidity. It's the responsibility of THE STYLIST AND SALON OWNERS to know the laws, inform the client and follow regulations. It is not the client's responsibility to know the 1000's of salon laws. This reeks of a #HASHTAG# IMHO! #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Interesting fact: Red hair and blue eyes are both recessive genes. It's very rare that they occur together. Most redheads have hazel, green or light brown eyes. Blue eyes/red hair happens in less than 1% of the population. It's one of the rarest hair/eye color combos.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yeah, I'll probably just buy a bed frame and mattress, then use my old bedding for now. I've got a nice aqua blue cheapo comforter set. Aqua looks nice in that room.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I don't get that at all.

		<document><![CDATA[Overall henna is a pain in the ass...Yeah, it's natural and better for your hair and your body.
