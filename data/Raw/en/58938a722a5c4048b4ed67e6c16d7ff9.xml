		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Honestly, I have no problem with either one of them being done.  I wish Bill Clinton had resigned, and then Al Gore would have been the incumbent. I'm upset about Al Franken because he is a friggin' comedian. These other guys couldn't keep it in their pants.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I remember thinking after I read All Quiet on the Western Front how shocking it was that there could have been any more war after WWI. Maybe it had such a profound impact on me because it was written from the German perspective. I think I was a sophomore in high school.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It's too easy to "cancel" people who disagree with us politically, so I'm glad you haven't. My hope is that people become normal Republicans again (I have a non trumpy friend who calls himself a "smart" Republican.) 1/2]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# What is wrong with you? Seriously - most of the GOP haven't even admitted that Biden is rightfully President?  And he is supposed to give in to their demands?  I think he's admirable for even talking to them.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I doubt if a Carlson viewer would harass anyone who looks like he could defend himself physically.  I suspect I would be a prime target as a 59-year-old, 63-inch woman. I honestly don't know how I would handle this, so I hope it doesn't happen. #HASHTAG# 🤪😷]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I think her future as a Republican is uncertain at best. She really believes that trump is a danger to our nation, and I take her at her word. Like you, I disagree with her on pretty much everything else. But I trust her to help save our country, if it isn't too late.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I like Rosie and I don't doubt that it came from a caring place.  It's just that everyone needs to be very careful with what they say about (any) President's minor children. Kids are off-limits - always. Which is why Rush making fun of Chelsea was particularly abhorrent.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# His parents drove him to the rally. Shame on them. What did they think was going to happen?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Because of the nursing home scandal or the sexual harassment allegations?  Because both should be investigated before he resigns. The GQP allowed their guy to try to overthrow our government. We Dems need to be more loyal than we are. #HASHTAG#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It looks like Dems have a tough time governing. However, McAuliffe was already Governor and seemed to have a positive record. But he said a couple of stupid things and white parents are afraid of their kids reading about Black history, so...]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# She holds trump accountable for Jan 6th and for The Big Lie, so may lose her leadership position. Her legislative voting record doesn't matter to the GOP.  Like you, I disagree with her on most issues but I do respect her for actually having principles.]]></document>
