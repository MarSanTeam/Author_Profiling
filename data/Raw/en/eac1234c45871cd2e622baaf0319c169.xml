		<document><![CDATA[My 2 week sabbatical from #USER# is coming to and end. Can't stand Olympic commercials for an hour. Been watching Gayle King on #USER# and it's painful to watch. She tries to dominate every segment and honestly, what are her credentials? I know, she's Oprah's friend]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Elan, before typing a moronic tweet, give a  listen. I might need to point out his coworker of 35 years is an African American.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Here is a question for any #USER# fan. What team right now would trade their #HASHTAG# QB to the Giants for Daniel Jones. Perhaps 3 teams?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Wouldn't a republican speak out about this, and perhaps yes, feel trumps wrath, but much more importantly, feel the gain in popularity of their constituents? Love to hear your opinion.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Your wife is as bad a liar as you and your dad. Has she told you she loves you? Likely another lie. Just used you to live lavishly. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Would love to see volunteers come out in droves today in #HASHTAG#. Volunteer to drive voters to the polls who may not have the means to get themselves there. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Next year at this time, we will look back and say to ourselves, what a horrible time in our countries history, the pandemic, record high unemployment and Trump as president. We will then say to ourselves, thank goodness we are in 2021.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If you wake up tomorrow and you hear that #HASHTAG# passed away overnight your initial reaction is?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Why should they wear a mask? It's not like we are in the middle of a pandemic. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Here is an example of bad reporting! The #USER# article calls her a blond vixen. Listen, anytime one can play connect the dots with someone's face, this is not a vixen! #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I wonder if #USER# is just plain stupid, or it comes from hitting his head against a wall every time his con for a father lies. (that would be a lot of hitting head against wall, I know)]]></document>
