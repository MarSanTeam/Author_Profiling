It's the "hot tip" from the DSM (as my course tells me) anyway]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It's an alarmingly transparent &amp; mendacious stance from the POV of outsiders (IMO).

One can only hope that this country's current PM won't blindly follow suit, even as a mere apologist. 🤞]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Yes, I know. Illness as we age (or at any time) is part of the human condition, no matter what some conspiracy befuddled loons think of "ebil bIg pHara" without looking outside their own yards to see how other countries regulate it 🙄]]></document>

Obviously, she might have been mentally ill, but the photo really doesn't give that impression 😂]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# As mentioned above - most Australian states recognize that arresting children aged 10 is generally inappropriate if not actually harmful.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Can be even longer if the person's lost weight. Cannabinoids are 1 of very few substances stored in human fat cells. If someone has to suddenly adjust to a starkly lower budget (i.e. loses their job) weight loss can be a knock-on effect]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They would all be right, too.
So, Capitalism is the fault of it's youngest participants? It's THEY who demand a lift to school in mum's 4WD &amp; a/c to live through the extreme climate they didn't create?

The excesses of Modernity are great AND dreadful according to him!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Me either 🙄]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That she was even allowed out of the hospital/back to uni for an exam within a week is absurd even if it was a straightforward laporascopic procedure! It could easily have opened either a hospital or the college up to a lawsuit. I think your Prof is full of 💩 tbh]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yep. Also, even though the current Govt WON'T admit that climate science plays a huge hand in the situation, the least they could've done was tackle the situation proportionately rather than showboat around on an endless PR tour.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I mean, you may enjoy her "singing" voice. I really did not, though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yeah, I know. I'm fairly sure that it wasn't produced far beyond the 1960s here (the FDA banned it entirely in 1983). While I was checking on that I discovered that it also caused all kinds of bladder &amp; urethral cancers. Ugh...]]></document>

I'm asking seriously, FWIW. I understand he's no fan of perceived or actual critique.]]></document>
