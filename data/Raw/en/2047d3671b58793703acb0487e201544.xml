		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My therapist has made the same observation to me after years of therapy. Kids often withdraw out of safety, which makes sense then. We need to as adults learn to be safe while being a full member of society at the same time. And that's a very, very difficult lesson to learn.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[The wind &amp; rain are random as f**k out in West Gres-ham today, but that hasn't stopped the grounds crew at the school behind our house from running leaf blowers for the past 45 minutes straight. JFC. I loathe them. To no freaking end, I loathe those machines.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yeah, it's one of our eight different cup competitions about something or other instead of working to strengthen the presence of USWNT players within their domestic league. I'm overly excited about this. #HASHTAG# #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yeah, but there are some huge names on the list that I have seen, so we might be Ok here. Can only lose 1 player if anybody is selected &amp; they can only choose 5 total so I can see where the odds are with us here. It's still unsettling though, but I'm believing beyond reason here.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Shakey's was a huge staple of my youth in Boise. One of the few restaurants my family could all agree upon going to that didn't involve varying degrees of emotional mayhem (sister was very picky eater, stepdad was a complete jerk, mom just wanted food &amp; peace, I loved pizza).]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Honestly, I was listening to radio a few days ago &amp; the songs all sounded very tinny &amp; offputting. I thought it was just the radio, as I played them digitally &amp; they were much better. This could explain the whole issue.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It's one of the various cup things to distract fans from the fact that USWNT really doesn't support their own domestic league. It's better if we make our monies from our own tournaments instead. Oh, wait, I said that out loud.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# But throwing money at it &amp; yelling into the void that we're awesome apparently is much more fun. Yet it's that belief that is ultimately killing off any momentum towards doing exactly what you stated - we accept what we are &amp; work to make it better for the future.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I don't blame people for not wanting to give MP ticket money, but that means them being replaced by others that don't care nearly as much.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I've worked in banking my entire career &amp; Black Friday is one of the craziest days for us because of all the retail activity.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Applaud you both for this. I understand the need for social media &amp; try to use it for those purposes only, but I will vent from time to time. But I'm much happier when I take walks about my neighborhood safely or work out.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I've reached the point in my work year where it's probably easier to tell me who is in the office versus who is out on vacation. I'm almost ready to put that as my Outlook notification - yes, I'm really here and working. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Former Timbers player news. He's back. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Only thing I will say is this - if he needs to go, there had better be a viable, available candidate that could replace him. I'm not versed enough to know who that might be, but replacing him doesn't immediately fix our issues IMHO. I do agree that changes need to occur &amp; soon.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# My current self understands this reality as I'm awaiting word on my new manager. My younger self despised this instability &amp; I think that's why my career stagnated for so long.

I love that selected US teams compete annually for the title of best soccer club.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I know what Rich is seasoned with after several seasons of watching him go Chara all over the pitch. We could honestly do a lot worse than letting him lace them up. If Keith is anything within the same vein as that, count me in.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This thread brought up emotions showing a list of #HASHTAG# supporters who are no longer with us, yet their memories live on.

Over 20 years, you would expect we could have helped build something that would be sustainable under all this, but the fact it crumbled in 3 weeks is troubling.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I have to get up early for work on weekdays &amp; I respect construction crews greatly for what they do, but you lose all credibility with me if you show up at your site near my house at 6:40 AM with your stereo up so loud it causes our windows to shake &amp; rattle. Seriously f**k off.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Sure, it's not my first rodeo about here. Still doesn't change how I feel about being insulted &amp; apparently I'm not alone in my disgust right now either. Just sharing my frustration amongst the RCTID crowd.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[As is now tradition this year, I won't be watching the NCAA brackety thing because you don't mess with a successful streak that works. Yes, I believe in superstitions. Am sending good vibes to the Bulldogs as I'm #HASHTAG#. I hope they keep on dancing until the end. Seriously.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I will trade you for some plums straight out of beautiful West Gres-ham. You can just taste the pluminess.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Good lord. So apparently the baptisms didn't take due to one word being changed. So instead of your soul being cleansed, the clear coat is now plaid colored or there's one less thing on the invincibility scale. FFS. I'm glad I gave up on Catholocism. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I've lost track of the number of explosions in my neighborhood &amp; I have 3 very terrified cats wondering what the hell is going on outside. To say I'm frustrated with my fellow humans right now is an understatement. But hey, enjoy your little explosions because you f**king can.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Considering I think that's what they do for other markets where they cover teams (Golden Knights, Jazz, etc), I think so. But I'd rather it be more spelled out than assumed at this point. We will see.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Or albums. I still have a ton of albums that I got from joining back in the day.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# We can go back to Sesame Street for the great lesson of what near is and what far is. Near fits the explanation per Grover, who trumps VAR so it stands. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# We have always needed that quality. IMHO Ridgy had the talent &amp; could light up teammates when needed. Seba is only one on current roster with any of that snark. It's needed badly.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Right because most kids know nothing of bad words. What kind of world do we live in to allow such disrespectful language? I'm going to need a moment to recover from all of this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My initial reaction to this statement as an alum is very much OUCH, but objectively speaking, you are correct based upon our current resume. We will need to finally win one to change that narrative.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Wow. I'm sorry to read this but glad you are on the mend. Best wishes for a great start to the new year!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# As annoying as that would be, it would be so like MLS to grant them a berth for that very reason just because.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Mariner TV ratings here are still very huge &amp; there is still a sizable contingent of people that travel to games up there. I was looking for some posts on it, but in talking with NBC Sports NW folks months ago, they mentioned Mariner TV ratings here were very substantial.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Dude. Ouch. Sending best wishes for a quick recovery.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Even if that is true - which is horrible if it is - that still doesn't excuse or justify his actions relating to the players over the years. Just when I thought they couldn't make things worse, they stoop to another lower level.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Zero times anything is still zero, unless math is somehow different in the GQP world. Which I don't think it is. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Our old Honda's gas gauge was really accurate until the car started having issues with starting. It got very finicky   before we donated it when it was struggling to start &amp; the gauge would go on and off at random times.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I remain in the corporate world where I'm bucking the trend &amp; taking care of me. Honestly, I've not been happier since making this choice.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Thanks for reminding me about that. Someone needs to end that streak and now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is fine. Really. Nothing to see here. This is all good. I mean, I learned how to say this correctly by watching hours &amp; hours of Looney Tunes back in my childhood, but hey, you do you. It's OK, whatever. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Us? Drinking? That's unpossible. Do you even know us?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Yes, the WICC controls what happens in the tournament, so they make the rules. Much like when CONCACAF comes to town, they set the match parameters.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Apparently in the US or up my butt depending on the various replies that I'm getting. :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Uh, okay, sure. I guess me wanting to save some money means putting up with lunacy &amp; idiotic behavior. Guess I should just put up with the stupidity. LOL.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# So O does come before U in this case?😬 I got no allegiance on either side, as our TV is watching something else. The game wasn't too insane last I checked. 😜😃]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That's the motto of our esteemed local publication. They'll have to find something more appropriate.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Tell us something we don't know, Rich.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# He's not fat, he's big boned. That's what my cat tries to tell me each and every day.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I've been reading a lot of the Vegas insider accounts talking about the challenges to keep venues open &amp; staffed. Can't even imagine everything they are trying to do in order to have people there to serve.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Tell #USER# to stop messing around and getting us all in trouble. This measure twice, cut once philosophy is nothing but trouble.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'd be honestly shocked if there wasn't. I've been there a few times in my day and never saw it myself, but take no ownership if this becomes an idea to spawn it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I have been lucky enough to have access to employees store each time I needed jackets, but the Dicks near my house always has wide range of sizes. Good luck in your search.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# FYI - the 150 is AQI, not temperature, although it's 102 and it certainly feels hotter than that outside. It's abjectly terrible.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thank you creepy NY robocall person. Your 6:42 AM call to me saying the IRS was coming for me was greatly appreciated.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Our cats are the same. It's 3 hours of running about creating havoc as loudly as possible, then eating a bare minimun to then begin begging for food in 30 minutes after being fed. It's the kitty cycle.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Fair point. And I am only pointing it out to emphasize how much supporters actually spend supporting their side. Fans IMHO don't spend nearly this much, but I know nothing about economics. Or money. Or soccer ⚽️. I can't believe the FO can't or won't understand the impact here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Good lord. Just make him stop already. Seriously. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Unsure for now, will let you know if anything changes.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It's Deadspin. I'm shocked if they write in complete sentences with proper grammar, so the intelligence part is just icing on the cake so to speak.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# West Gres-ham would like the trash to stay exactly where it is, simply as we already have our own issues going on.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I can't imagine having her as a representative of your state or community. Can't think of anybody that could possibly be worse, especially the not knowing how she will engage from moment to moment.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I love the Timbers but this is a completely stupid statement to say it never happened. They could have said anything else, but instead chose this language. It's been nagging with me ever since to be honest.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thank you Kentucky for keeping this @$$clown in office so he can effectively stop any meaningful changes that are needed within our government to help people that need it. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I, for one, love the bots making crap up as our new news leader. And I remind them as a media member myself that I can be used to herd together soccer fans for useless &amp; pointless purposes. Or not. :) #HASHTAG# #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[After waiting 30 minutes on chat for service, my queue time has been quoted as less than 1 minute. For the past 45 minutes. This seems totally fine in terms of customer service I would think.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Proud of this team under the circumstances of 2021. It's going to be a wild one next weekend back at Providence Park when they host MLS Cup. #HASHTAG# #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I hope this gets resolved in the right manner. Supporters sections need to be set aside &amp; treated as such by all teams. I can't fathom a team not making that clear or insisting on it for traveling supporters. Best way to avoid any hassles on game day.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Not that I want to beat up somebody more than they might already be doing, but hopefully they understood the significance of the banner &amp; won't let something like this happen again.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Yeah, we are such terrible people and don't get along with anybody. Now you know the dirty little secret. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Stay up all night. Or just show up half asleep. Whatever works.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My cable provider. If I say their name several times outloud, it conjures up bad spirits, so I shall not invoke the dark side. But it's probably not hard to guess who it it. And yeah, my company's chat has some great response times, so when something is really bad, it stands out.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Todd, it was a really big card and they carried it around the entire park.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I believe in faith &amp; the concept of having a wonderful community that people can belong to. However, any "religion" that can allow such monstrous behavior under the guise of their beliefs can get bent. Don't use a belief in God as a cover for extremely hateful behavior. #URL#]]></document>
