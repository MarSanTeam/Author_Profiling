Shion and Gyaokuren have an antagonistic rivalry that seems almost homoerotic in a very Cat on a Hot Tin Roof way where the sharing of women is like touching each other, I'm quite dead serious) on moon base]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA["They should hire the best" means a lot of piss and shit to me when I've seen the worst of the worst or the most mediocre of things cishet white men have done and just what gets accepted as reality or pop culture or whatever, because Michael Bay isn't going to stop making movies]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[From anything really, it doesn't  have to be a "bad trip" for you to think you can fly or from you slowly hovering over the balcony until you and your friends only realize too late that you're actually falling out bc you're falling asleep--any lack of bodily awareness issues]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[But the actual reality sans 70s New York and a few serial killers from that era and area--most serial killers are cops or former cops, most serial killers operate bc they are able to escape the police for too long often by targeting sex workers in fact.... just a lot of factors]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[.... honestly just realized something: we already know Peter turned out fucked up and I remember in the third book Lupin probably admits that Peter was kinda jealous and mistreated
.... and we knew they were super mean to Snape

why was the pantsing such a bfd oh my god]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Recca has a status quo to protect when the bad ninjas come in to wreck shit that gets added onto with additional allies--now you're part of my fambly, now you're part of my status quo

Naruto lacked that so hard I feel like fans make up for what was lacking in relationships]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[.... I mean these fucking idiots let Son of Sam escape the first time. That was when I dropped out of the doc cuz I'm like "ok the FUCKING DIPSHITS who allowed this to happen are being interviewed and their answers ARE FUCKING SHITTY"nIf it's not a misogynist killing sex workers-]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And we just have so few examples of actually successful revolutions, and there's reasons for that besides "Man it's crazy how kids will just wear a t shirt of Che Guevera"
like do they think every social/popular movement needs a Che Guevera, and that he was betrayed by comrades]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I've tried to have sims console other sims and it just doesn't work even if they're really close friends and I'm like "WHY IS THIS AN OPTION" and it's because it's a Parenthood thing and they need fucking higher emotional competency or parenting skill in order to console ppl]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and no it's not like how a director favors a certain pool of actors--that's great, that's how it should be in certain cases

this is just the machine dictating casting

Sorkin wants to pretend it's a fucking creative decision casting that man and it's just not, it's the machine]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[basically the worst to happen on psychadelics is dehydration if you're vomitting or not eating and drinking over a course of several hours--this is n ot a death situation, just an icky sicky thing
the actual worse thing is running away and falling or ending up somewhere unsafe]]></document>

Starting with "fuck you" songs, basically

		<document><![CDATA[Time Machines and Kids Going Back In Time To Learn History was so hackneyed by the time Time Squad was created that the main character definitely looks like Sherman from Sherman &amp; Mr. Peabody.... which was a show from the fucking 50s-60s, oh my god it's such a cliche.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think Squid Games was so compelling bc there was this  grim acceptance you as a viewer went through after the second or third episode--"okay, this is just... we can assume almost everyone is gonna die, now"
knowing that probably pulls us more than the uncertainty would]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's not some resultant of your popularity, it's a cultivated image by marketers and agents and other shit like that--literally everyone involved in the image making process, in promotion and marketing of celebrity
that's what created "look at where they are now"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Even in a case like Dahmer or other gay serials you have often a record of targeting not just young men but young men of color, so there you go, it's often just a power balancenblack serial killers usually just kill black women. ya dig? this is all following our normal structure]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[A mildly amusing movie with some okay character moments is like "oh my god this is it, we're doing super hero group movies now"

I'm like pained rn that Justice League got such bullshit when it's a great fucking super hero team that has interpersonal dynamics we know about]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hey I like any animal lover think that Joe should be in jail for wtf he did to animals, not some gonzo murder for  hire plot
I don't think the feds had anything to do with what the dudes admitted??? Like were they saying they worked *with* the feds, so he would be jailed???]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We hate our neighbor that's not following mandates bc they're suddenly paranoid and conspiracy ridden but of course we should always and forever be angry and direct our anger at people feeding them misinformation
we need to vax these fuckers with kindness at this point]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I don't want these uggo NFTs, I'm just constantly surprised at how it goes against anyone's sensible aesthetic tastes]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I've seen 57 of these &amp; contest quite a few as being "must watch". LEON is uncomfortable; you never need to watch a Polanski movie; the Departed... Replace with Gangs of New York, it's not a remake--Army of Darkness is way better than Evil Dead. V white &amp; masculine #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There's seriously horrible memories of me looking at *fanfiction* fucking FANFICTION
And realizing
".... I never wrote it out, I just fucking wrote an outline"

HEARTBREAKING, do you have any idea?! THAT'S the feeling I'm talking about]]></document>

after I cried about fuckin Mood obviously being her brother FUCK YOU GOD DAMN IT WITH THE 12 YEAR OLD GIRL
FOR NO FUCKING GOOD REASON AT ALLLLL]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I had to stop watching when I realized this criminal mastermind quite simply targeted hundreds of young black women and girlsnnwhat a puzzling and profound mystery, how on earth did this man go uncaughtnnALL these fuckers get caught when they fuck with "middle America" as it were]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And since I'm a writer I generally can always tell where a narrative is going anyway; it's hard to genuinely surprise me and I'm happy when it happens but it's not something I generally expect maybe as much as a casual audience member]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and oh my god, no one can stand Adam Driver or Benedict Cumberbatch that much--my parents told me Bradley Cooper was in Nightmare Alley and I was like "I THINK THAT'S RALPH FIENES OR MAYBE LIAM NIESSAN???"
fucking not knowing if that's Matt Damon or Mark Wahlberg]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Everyone's barrier to entry is going to be understanding and interpreting those old white guys--I don't know how much academia will change in that sense, where a lot of our understanding will be impeded by how much we understand the concepts some old/dead dude is laying down]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Centrists just think somehow a revolution can lead to such extremes in human behavior or authority that just... it doesn't take into account when revolutions are taken over by larger powers that then influence shit]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You can tell compositional things but you don't know what the paint looks like on a canvas in the exact right lighting, which is when tons of abstract art ppl love to criticize was actually made
we've totally gone back to "close to model as possible" and it makes sense why]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I literally saw that and couldn't comprehend how this person kept responding to people

How about having little to no opinion on China because I can only rely on world news for sources
So I can only criticize incidents that get reported on individually]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That would prompt you to immediately be concerned for sex workers, who obviously aren't hurting anyonenIt would prompt you to be concerned with any marginalized or vulnerable person above wanting to beat up bad guysnThat's my ideal for what we can be as a society]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That's why I think the Return  is really just David Lynch doing like a Breaking Bad or Sopranos version of Twin Peaks in a way--it's Twin Peaks but Golden Age of Television
Which is why I think the Dougie arc is so worthwhile, because it's exactly that but SOMETHING IS REAL OFF]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You'd literally again need very specific skill sets that are measurable--so how fast you can do a thing

but again
you've cut out everyone who can't test well under pressure
you need alternative ways to measure competency besides some objective standard you hope everyone can show]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I just know I hate that this Horrible Woman saw exactly one more book to write and said "FLEUR AND THIS HANDSOME WEASLEY DON'T DESERVE WEREWOLF TROUBLES 😰😖let's make Remus' situation fucking worse to save them lol" LIKE WHYYYYYYYYYYY]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I dunno, if you look at Che's biography, besides looking at how the guy fucking looks.... it seems worthy that he's on a t-shirt, morbid and sad as that is
It's like, this dude was kind of a fucking badass, you don't need to have political affiliations to go "that's impressive"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I dunno it's just reminding me of casual homophobia I experienced in high school where people didn't think or consider things rationally before concluding gay people were just very embarrassing, pathetic or gross--perverse, whatevernIt's done to non-binary people now as well]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I don't know if this was the original version they heard, I believe Breakaway has been covered by other female pop vocalists
So yes, a bit ironic
but it's also like--this isn't hard to make grungy, is it?!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[CUZ THAT'S THE SHIT THAT THE OTHER OG PERSON WAS DEALING WITHJ HJKFAJKFA

BAD! It's becoming a cycle, you canNOT make it a "binary trans/nonbinary trans thing" cuz it's not even a queer thing IT'S A FUC KING TWITTER THING]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Sorta no matter how you react to your lot in life, the shit you've gone through, no matter if it was racism or tranphobia or just people being dicks to you for bullshit reasons--
that kinda stuff goes a little beyond the political realm even if it is technically political, partly]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[or even just taking drugs period, psychedelics have a few quirks that ultimately only make them dangerous for ppl who have psychosis in their genes and we can't all know that can we
it didn't break me when I took shrooms, it just did  nothing, so.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Academia constantly needs to be humbled and brought to reality: people need to bring their realities to academia and teach their specialties in the way they define and understand itnAny other way and you have a bunch of dead white guys deciding what's truth and what's legitimate]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I would think a normal friendly guy would be like "oh well" and then hang out with the girl and roommate anyway bc that just appeals to her more???

So I can't tell if this show that has horror elements is tryin to tell me something or not]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One day I'll read Notes on Camp and compare it to the SACD series because honestly I think it qualifies as naïve camp--sometimes he's definitely being funny on purpose, but it becomes a very campy running joke if it's not just this one-off joke, ya know]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Just the idea that you can't defend China without defending genocide of an ethnic minority who shant be named least I get a bunch of white knights who think knowing about an issue fucking fixes jack or shitnnNo one's allowed nuance and I don't see anyone helping the situation]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I don't buy it because the first three books... was baked with that nuance already jfklashf
First book: Snape is an asshole but NOT a saboteur or a... not a traitor to Dumbledore I should say
Second book: All red herrings were actually innocent
Third book: SIRIUS IS INNOCENT]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[that is way more the case for LSD than crack because LSD and most psychedelics tap into completely different  parts of your brain--Aldous Huxley wrote about his psychadelic trip, like philosophers and intellectuals were obviously gonna indulge if they smoked, drank and took meds]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I thought the problem was internet harassment but it turns out you can trace all internet harassment to exactly one source

Admittedly ppl with big platforms fuck up in this way but wow dawg, I'm just seeing people get in their feelings and be irrational AND ALSO MISGENDERING]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[She SORT OF has some shoujo monologue like "what's gotten into him?!" rather than being like "fucking weird, I need to stay away from him now and tell his mom or something, maybe something is wrong with him"

but like that's... I'm used to and fully engulfed in those tropes]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[cuz obviously tons of the supers are fucking mutations and they had the ability to be like "fuck it, if they're not aliens, they're mutations--end of story"
A genius bit of lorebuilding that DC just completely lacks when it comes to a cohesive larger world

Completely missing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Most ppl don't know what it's like to be discriminated against vividly and openly, as a queer person, as a non-christian--I've had experiences where people don't think I'm even white
Most people don't know what institutionalization looks or feels like
That means we should listen]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[&amp; I just knew from then on it was absolutely just to shake people's consciousness and reconcile what the fuck white supremacy is--it was a conservative problack bullshit speech, but behind all that, oh man do I see a point in becoming that weirdly radical
I lvoed the queer ones]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If you're a real true crime watcher since you were a paranoid 13 yr old, you know the system sucks, police and detectives often give up after a few weeks of a murder, you know they weren't always sharing information, you know the system lets rapists go who become serial killers]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You could say they were unprepared and I could tell you the earliest we've known about serial killing--they weren't looking after sex workers. If they were, they'd be like "okay, sex workers are starting to turn up missing--we might have a serious SK on our hands" for real]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[or maybe more appropriately, normal offenders looking to level up their  game and become complete bastards, but failed even at that
It's that failure part that gets me. It factors in to how serial killers give up to the police--they sometimes mock police w/ what they know]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yeah Robocop goes on overtime just for occasions like this, poor hardworking robo-fella he is]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So like
It's like that
It's deeper than it's validating and makes you feel good--it's real life
It's real life shit that has ups and downs and isn't perfect or even always great
It could get really shitty with my social anxiety &amp; other people still being jerks to you]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[PLEASE SAVE MY EARTH, best OVA, don't bother with the manga the OVA practically ends it though sometimes I kinda wanna read it but then I don't, cuz the OVA doesn't deal with as much sexual abuse and trauma as the manga does

Watch that, come back and tell me I'm wrong about shit]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's just whenever I think about this situation I think about all of the asylum seekers locked up in cages and all of the horrific shit America and Europe has done wrt scooping up ethnic minorities and putting them into camps

Like obviously it's super fucked--not worse than us]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Like yes, when you get fired or quit, those benefits and the job security no longer applies

But in a strike you're fighting for your right to those benefits and for job security
You're deliberately making the choice not to quit and lose the job and benefits--you still want that]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So for instance, a lot of past Sims games, you could have a really tight schedule your Sim went through or you could have more open gameplay--you could really pick and choose by what you did, especially if you had kids or not
I always feel like I never have a schedule w/ Sims 4]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I just need to get smthin off my chest bc I keep seeing it around and it's really pissing me off

There is no real hypothetical scenario where incest is completely consensual.
Siblings have immediate and obvious power dynamics btwn them--not just a matter of age, either]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Maybe when we see white people fruitlessly argue the same things in an attempt to shield the system from real criticism we can call it shooting an elephant, cuz they're just doing the most incompetent job at shielding anything
but they're doing it cuz they think they have to]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thereby if you wanna make a BTAS like live action Batman movie--you'd better find a way to say it's related to that, so the marketers can use that on a strong foundation rather than the more rickety and less reliable "it's *like* this thing"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Sometimes the obvious totally slips by me bc I get hyper focused--in this case I just want to break the game and I'm not finding opportunities to do so
nothing happens if you go manage to go down certain areas I was able to circumvent--I just had to start over :(]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think very honestly Mormons were the only one who realized "Oh if like everyone before us are in heaven and it's paradise--we're obviously becoming space gods, right?" like it's a scarily logical conclusion for the Christian faith, bat shit as it is--more so than just floating]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[btw I hate when people don't understand that Roger Waters and most people his age didn't have the same education we had
Teachers hit my step dad with rulers and chalkboard erasers
Waters is describing a physically and emotionally abusive system that was going on when he was young]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[but like a comedic adventure should really be her wheelhouse cuz her serious face is like... it's not as good

The latter half of the series just had the humor sucked from it in a way that's pretty unforgivable by the last book]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But fucking weirdly, you don't have similar hallucinations in other conditions where you lack oxygen--like being at certain altitudes doesn't always consistently create the hallucinations or the necessary chemical response
Prob cuz it's the choking doing it &amp; not just lack of O2]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A CHRISTIAN DUDE, PROBABLY A CATHOLIC, LOOKED AT THIS SHIT AND WENT "Okay y'all are taking it too far now, you know what you're doing when you're demonstratively burning their religious leaders--this ain't very Christianly" he talked like that of course]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA["I fucked with your mind, all I came here to do--BYEEEEE" that's a Joker I can get behind bc that's the playful part of the nihilism--it doesn't exactly always matter who he kills and I'm sure he would get annoyed at the idea of being forced to kill someone than doing it for fun]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And the reality is that MK Ultra was really just taking advantage of a counter culture that was already using drugs habitually, it's not like during the 60s everyone started using drugs more bc of the FBI's conditioning
everyone was using drugs before the 1960s]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[As a non-binary person who's met with other non-binary people and been to the gender clinic before--for me, being GNC wasn't enough to feel like myself around other people. I don't even think I feel like myself around family.I'm closeted cuz I don't wanna hurt them by saying that]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Probably way more than others cuz HUH BOY
Oh is a middle schooler trying to gain confidence through toxic masculinity?? How fucking interesting, what you mean to tell me there's some real cartoonish design

this is why I only watched DBZ and thought Dragon Ball is a stern Okay]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Not bc I really care about him but using the word love bombing in this way is.... not helpful

it's not good to just victimize yourself in a situation where you probably need to self-reflect and not just blame a person who harmed you or tricked you

I got scammed one time]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And I'm unwilling to argue on the queer coding that's been pretty resplendent throughout the Batman series to the point where Frank Miller in some attempt to make it maybe gross made the hottest version homoerotic of the Joker
just the way he put on lipstick for Batman? so hot]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[To me it's not "just how do you even stop crime" bc to me that's a political question that Sherlock Holmes was more interested in than Batman was
Batman is kinda like, all the villains become obsessed over Batman, and Gotham is where it takes place--it was once crime-ridden]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[*fetal position* I've literally started back into HP fics bc emotionally my rl became fraught loooool

I need somewhere to pour my angst

it's weird cuz at the same time I sitll have the pull to do the original thing, I'm just less energized and feel a bit sick when I think of it]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So the way all fanfic writers do conflict is like ".... they get into an argument!" and it's like lol no, you can have outside forces or more internalized conflict, those things exist besides "let's make the couple get into an argument bc that's an obvious place to go"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[.... Parks and Rec, why are you saying OH NO DON'T FREAK THEM OUT is it bc you're fucking guilty of letting your daughter go out in a blizzard

In a regular schmegular movie you coulda found her frostbitten and asleep out in the snow after she GETS LOST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE SHIT]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[John Singer Sergeant portrait on the cover of a book "oh wow, that's a great painting"

same portrait real life "THAT. IS. GIGANTIC. WHAT THE FUCK OMG" I lost my mind lol it's gorgeous, so detailed]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He spikes his hair up for Robin and looks like a goofy boy ward to Wayne Manor with his hair perfectly parted like a preppy good boy
it's not like 100% effective against anyone really doing their research ofc
this new Riddler design feels in part like rejection of domino masks]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He could also aptly describe the sensation of losing someone the way they lost Syd
Where he would wander in exactly one time into a session, listen to what they had produced so far, and call it shit before ghosting away back to live with his mother]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So to me it gets heated once it's personal and it becomes personal easily when it's a subject that involves marginalization and bigotry, right?
we're not really looking to get bad apples out, we're looking to spread better ideas and counter popular narratives that spring up]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'M DYING LOOKING AT THIS CAST phhewww okay okay
Dom Deloise we all know and love, he deserves to be here.... MALCOM MCDOWELL HJKFLAH
ED ASNER okay omg CAROL CHANNING IS IN THIS, THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE OKAY yes I remember Phyllis Diller

IT'S LIKE THAT]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[My choice as a writer would have been "yoda gets out his lightsaber
and he promptly sprints across the room, a near blur to Palpatine and the audience"
like fighting a rodent--mice are scary bc they look like blurs when they move, so small &amp; fast]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's that our government sponsored a program to try and do mind control for fucking real and literally used government employees to do that and covered up their subsequent deaths--it's that thing
not... fucking modern art or degenerate culture, you fashy weirdos]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I don't think anyone who likes comics likes the myriad of bullshit stuff that has to do with "canon" and "universes" but maybe that's just speaking as a primarily manga fan--it seems messy and pointless to me
Super cool to have a shared universe
Super shaky to demand canon]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If you don't treat her like the matriarch SHE WILL TELL YOU TO
IN GERMAN
WHy would she care if this redneck ass family can't understand HER SON CAN, THAT'S WHY SHE'S SAYING IT]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You know what I just think about sometimes: the Jurassic Park dinosaurs could have been mutated to be like

Pygmy dinosaurs
And then you'd be able to sell them as pets

They really chose the less profitable venture imo, and obviously the more dangerous one!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Having worked with kids: they think so hard they not only gain tunnel vision or stop paying attention, they think expressively on their face--you can see when they're off in their own fantasy space
they think as they speak and figure shit out
they're not just happy or sad]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Really that hypothetical should make you consider how much we need from the global south--rubber, cobalt, different food stuffs, things we probably never even considered
Workers are exploited everywhere but nowhere near as much post or current colonial states
It's not hidden]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Sometimes theyre literally trying to get into fucking super hero high school and y'all are just like "HunterxHunter and fucking my hero are like--wow, what unique pieces of art" SAME STORY I'M SORRY THAT'S MY POSITION ON SHOUNEN
Evangelion is unique cuz it confronts the real shit]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[but in a movie full of three action women the part I fucking remember is her being naked afraid and vulnerable to a man who betrays her after sleeping with her
like I wonder how it'd play if I rewatched it BUT I'M NOT REWATCHING THAT MOVIE
I saw it once already]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[it's not even as nefarious as "I'm going to get this person addicted to a drug--then I can sell a story" no.... just everyone is on drugs or casually uses them, how about that? and we make fun of the ones b eing messy about it or doing some hard stuff
it's more narrative framing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[W/ enough trans people to no longer see their "past" gender as the one defining them as they are--not seeing them as "man transed into a woman" or "woman  trans into a man" but a person who's a woman, a man or non-binarynThe next step is even seeing non-binary people as existing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He's like so aware these manga are printed and ready to distribute to future Japanese over-workers like himself that he's just spelling out how the absent father makes Gon sort of... a little child asshole
I immediately picked that up when he just leaves his mom, very deliberate]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Kids to actually be friendly with each other
Instead it's like "this person's project was the best, they get the highest point on the tree and three gold stars" basically, lol
and it continues on like that, which explains a lot of seemingly "quirky" things like nerd-hate]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Such a messy chaotic mess of a story that basically amounted as a way to sell comic books

I'm just. I guess that was the one people didn't like? I don't remember
I don't even know if purple people eater was a crossover event
I just know the X men are fucking missing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and most people don't know that crazy rich people still buy wildly experimental art, it's just that it's such high quality (from my experience often optical illusions? maybe that was just a fad) and so niche and impressive it's just hush hush in the know and not widely talked abt]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's not in the best interest of anyone to keep Sherlock in the sphere of pop culture influence without reassessing the canon in a way that's like
Welcoming towards new modern readers and not extremely hostile]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It needs to be fuckin said this copaganda also kept putting sex work as a black hole for crime--there were some ppl arguing for decriminalization, but more people saying "this pervo serial killer had THE WORLD AS HIS OYSTER" like nevermind these sex workers were unprotected?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You'd be more obligated to talk about Warhol than Pollock bc at least Warhol had complete control over his images and art and Pollock, again, was dead by the time his art sold
and Warhol was super weird, he collected artists, he's a complete outlier to what most artists are]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And make Krampus a force of holiday nature or make it the fault of a guilty party and not... not an innocent kid

Like I think it'd be much better if Omi summoned the Krampus to punish the redneck family and was like "well, you weren't good all year.... so, sorry" abt the teen]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I may seem allergic to the grind but I can tell you that it's anxiety and other issues cuz I don't easily escape into doing other things--I have to *force* myself to procrastinate least I just stare at nothing or stay on social media all day]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Drew Barrymore is a small lady, she was in a huge sheet that just swallowed her up--obviously supposed to be nude beneath
She looked completely unthreatening. she's supposed. to be. ya know. POWERFUL MAYBE
the sheet is for the rating cuz nude would've been empowering]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[if he has dwarfism and a hunchback I think he's disabled??? he would have different needs
I'm just like--I'm thinking golden/silver age if he's not explicitly a small person then he's a short guy who thinks he's ugly??? that seems correct to me? lol]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[What grown man fucking just keeps working when you have a bleeding gashing wound on your hand

Which just happened incidentally as far as I can tell

Peter's real slick but that man walked into his death by under-estimating him]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Trans men have the problem of displaying these behaviors as "women", being praised for it, and continuing on a destructive path of egotism and superiority complexes without nearly as much scrutiny bc no one cares about them lolnNon-binary ppl can all have this problem, all of us]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[wtf some people ejaculated while being hung--god damn, imagine if you were a fetishist back in the day when people were being hung, how fucking sick and twisted is that
I guess only the examiner would see your shame though I kinda had the wrong image for that in my head, LOL]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'm not talking trustfund kids, either. I'm talking abt artists who enter industries that aren't necessarily made for wealth and somehow they end up lucky and end up at least with some assets or a ~millionaire~ of sorts
Most artists fall into this category more than other folks]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[the other three were obviously the much more aesthetically gorgeous members while Sporty and Scary were cooooool or like against the grain??? Yeah it came out in vocals and dancing
And you end up comparing these poor people
Like it's less nuanced than a debate abt rock bands?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Obviously no culture has a 100% dead set rule on ghosts bc we don't have ontological proof and reality consensus on ghosts, so there are no rules besides being dead
I just think of her keeping her individuality as such a wrong headed idea if you're trying to get out of purgatory?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is sort of the anonymity vs fucking social media problem
Before social media, we were a lot more covert about IRL stuff--people were hesitant to post pics of themselves outside of friend groups
Even on Myspace, we had some anonymity choices--not using our full real names]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Lady Bird was extremely white for me when she went to a Catholic schoolnLady Bird would be the lone red head in a sea of Latinx children--also with some Asians because almost all white areas have some Asian people, they're very prominent herenHer fake dream home was also ugly]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They obviously know the Riddler is human enough that he disguises himself so he can probably have some kind of semi-normal life on the surface of things--he can still walk in normal society and people don't IMMEDIATELY see it's the Riddler, that sort of deal]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I remember the art classes where I ended up having more serious and academic peers and like
they were all very young and social
they wouldn't necessarily take certain coldness or lack of response well
I guess you're supposed to be taught these skills in teacher school but pfft]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[sorry art collectives are not weird--I mean more that while he would sponsor an artist he definitely wanted to be closely associated or would sometimes use people, he had a lot of power in the NY scene for a while--I mean, it's NYC, that's a lot of power to wield]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and I think the current situation under capitalism allows us more mob than collective mentality
I think it's probably unfair to paint the main characters as like... ciphers for the audience completely--they were really fucked up in their own way, they contributed to the issues]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[She's so good you understand her motives perfectly well but we didn't get a full picture demonstration without conflict that just showed her enjoying the lifestyle and getting free stuff
Instead every part of the film is full of some type of conflict from get go, no good rest]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[so it's less weird that random celebrities are pictured with Andy Warhol bc.... boy, he threw some gay as fuck fun parties that like--my step parent actually went to one cuz they're a super boomer
they just described the old wasps just losing their minds at men in thongs--50s-60s]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There's just a determination to have this Tolkien-made archetype bc you like your D&amp;D set ups with elves and dwarves, even though that was never the foundation of fantasy for realsies
talking animals are more foundational for fantasy than arbitrary "race" systems]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also lol Casino Royale bored me to death, try Skyfall??? There's so many I could replace with that are either foreign, gay, considered chick flicks, whatever
More black and white stuff, too. Like not just Hitchcock, try on some Sunset Boulevard and more Billy Wilder flicks]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So basically: comics aren't necessarily profitable. They're kind of a boom and bust or bubble market--things get popular and make money in bursts. You're not guaranteed to make money back on an investment into someone else's comic book idea, like not fucking at allllll]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I hope the 12 year old who drew it is funging his ether right now]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I wanna put into the Peterson discourse that I remember the amount of kloni he claimed to have been taking was a WILD AMOUNT for a skinty tall man like himself.
I've halved myself to 0.5 mg, 1 mg a day, taken twice a day
this guy was taking like 5 mg or some shit! oh my god]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They both have people vying for their love as they're dating/falling for each other AND THEY END UP HAVING THIS FANTASTIC CHEMISTRY TOGETHER
where like you're actually stanning them and now along for the ride to see them once in a while and go "they're so perfect for each other"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I sometimes get really angry at the generalization that non-binary people are generally extremely young teenagers or college students and not like... thirty year olds who grew up in very queerphobic environments, where transphobia is one of the last standing -phobias]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[which you can easily set up bc the Penguin more than any villain could see "oh this is some rich tool, it has to be" and see easily "he's also handsome and in shape? yeah fuck this guy" literally all you need to give him serious temperament problems when he thinks of that Bat guy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And it's deep bc it's p genuine insecurity; him and Two-Face in my head connect bc they both know their physical forms are kinda inescapable (in their POV) and don't harbor illusions abt ppl genuinely finding them attractive
but you know Penguin looks at his handsome side &amp; HATES]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[not so much to some kinda imposter syndrome or like even "i'm so bad I can never improve"

I worry sometimes I'm too fucking weird

I don't know who to go to in order to relate I'm afraid of not being understood in a BAD WAY]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[so the only way you would rewrite this to be about... fuckin losing hope and that being bad enough to punish someone for (?!?!?!?!?! WHY)

you had the snowglobe ending in mind
and you were just like "I just want Krampus to have like a snowglobe collection in hell"
.... okay, sure]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I guess I'll have to play Wolfenstein cuz now I'm remembering a part where a clear act of terrorism is framed as completely justified, because it just is, you're fighting Nazis

Just that series having a clear idea of what an enemy is to a soldier is good, I wish Nazis weren't--]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Photorealism happened the same way rendering details in oil paintings happened--technology
so yeah, not only is it now way easier to make an abstract piece than something cannily real in a digital era so the values change--it's also been democratized, so everything is different!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[he hasn't actually fucked all these women so obviously a lot of this is just validation and some kind of thing for him
A game, sure, he could just be your standard sexist PUA who's like "lol see negging doesn't work, fellow men" but I don't see that]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Terry Pratchett if he had written a species like this.... gladly would have liberated them and followed their rebellion as they all struggle against their instincts to survive

Rowling takes this and just immediately goes "and they can't take freedom" conservative ass position]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I guess I tweeted all this to say that true crime can veer towards copaganda and you can be someone like me and go "oh yeah good job cops you did SUCH A GOOD JOB, GOO GOO GAGA WE HUMANS WE MAKE MISTAKE WE MAKE POOPY" like I'm not... falling for the trick so easily, for reasons]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Alan Moore and Frank Miller did not set out to be fucking "grim dark" you big fat doofuses who think that
They set out to write for an audience of adults who had stayed in the fucking market for years
All of their comics were a response to the Golden and Silver age, all of it]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[by that I mean Andy Warhol deserves some acclaim even just an ounce for being wildly gay but rich enough to flaunt that in front of old/conservative money, his gay shit was definitely radical art by that era's standards
but yeah individuals don't make up movements, several do]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[ultimately on a psychological level I think that's better for everyone--the stubborn ones will realize that they'll be pitching in to work in a real way, now, and come to their humanity through contributing to society directly instead of using and manipulating people
as for evil]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And like no fucking duh: if you take something from a fan, CREDIT THEM?!?! Paying them is ideal but at the very least credit them!!! Make them a permanent part of canon in a gratifying way instead of claiming you only have two writers

OOF. That gets my goat, that's super fucked]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The Macaroni mafia are distinctly unfun in a way that is of course a detriment to any comic book that's trying to re-explore Batman's origins--his origins are boring until he meets his first costumed villain
But you need to establish their rule over the city and what's "normal"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[also very much wanna emphasize: it's IDOL music around the world but particularly in Korea and Japan and wherever else fucking idols CAN'T OPENLY DATE PEOPLE
it's like.... teens and young adults signing their life away to often not even write songs themselves
in a saturated way]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If not allow, implicitly be okay with bc there's literal stories and myths of androgynous figures that are like--legendary hero status, so it's like, you have some cultural context and representation that scares the family off and gives you a lot m ore clout and pride basically]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I can totally see Timothy Leary as a plant, but that's besides the point bc psychadelics just became accessible for reasons I can't remember--I'm sure they became simpler to synthesize &amp; were used for psych experiments originally
People woulda taken the drugs without much push]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And people seem especially mad at demi-gendered people bc they appear and would be regarded as cisnBut it's likenIt's not taking it consideration that person's entire life journey and how they felt on the inside the entire timenThey either do or don't fail at cishetero monogamy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He needs to prove himself, stand his ground--this is building character for him or an intellectual exercise for himnSo more often than not, I've mostly argued with cis men on intellectual things--hardly any cis women at all in that corner, bc it's men who are questioning me]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And now I just bounced out of people talking about Spidderman like he's the crowning glory achievement of art and life really, like a fine wine or a classical painting, really

"I thought this movie was great"
"Critical and box office failure"
"BUT THE THEMES"
... in spoidermen]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Summary of a post I read: "PLEASE, I AM GOOD AT TECH

WHAT ON EARTH IS MY XFINITY ID, AND HOW COME THE THREE THINGS THEY SAY IT IS DOESN'T MATCH MY PASSWORD"

these fucks just said "OOPS WE DON'T RECOGNIZE YOUR TV" and auto-logged me in at the same time ._.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA["no no I have to focus on the story, I've  been doing such a good job this whole time" the entire series is disconnected as fuck and the things that do come back are the ones you don't want to come back
I wish mangaka were giving more writers, they kinda need that system]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Like that's the actual luxury market, producing something for a rich person that's like "oh yeah this is like insanely time intensive" type shit
which still includes oil paintings, just now of different subjects
Pollock isn't even significant in abstract or all of art history]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[do  the people making the ape and lion bots that spit out ugly images ever consider.... like
you could absolutely fix your algorithm so every time an image is generated, it has good color coordination
you can fix it so that it more likely comes up with matching accessories]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Which is nothing compared to anxiety from those experiencing racism bc that's genuinely feeling threatened and unsafe--I know bc that's what gay bashing feels like, you feel unsafe, you don't know what this person would do or approve of when they show that ugly side to themselves]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[both things meaning truth and lies

we need Fauci and some vaccine skeptic to do the whole lying-truth riddle
"ask Dr. Fauci a question so you know Doctor WhoTheFuck is telling the truth or lying"

I laugh bc it's like--it shouldn't have been this difficult to market]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I actually think my entire contempt for a lot of this shit can be summed up as "And the X men are nowhere to be seen" cuz a, they're the best thing about that comic book universe, and b, you're literally missing an entire important huge part of LORE FOR THE FUCKING WAR, OH MY GOD]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's also not a "this lady did better" it's literally what song procedes the next
Kelis just embodied ladies that'd come ten or twenty years after her prime
being pretty and having a gorgeous voice and like basically rapping kinda--lord I love Kelis dear god]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Even if I have to think a bit or plot my course out, I can still sneeze out 5k or more kinda like it's nothing bc it's become easier for me, and that was a deep personal struggle that involved needing to get better medication
everyone's on their own journey &amp; confidence matters]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's ethically wrong and it's as creatively bankrupt as I can imagine--I hate writers trying to write in reaction to fans, we're always very twisted on our ideas of our own work versus people's responses, it's almost never a good reaction--it's always a bit exploitative!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA["Sorry Batman's wrong" I think is the most deeply fannish sentiment I have towards the entire franchise--I know he's wrong because all his villains are mentally ill and I love all his rogue's gallery so much more than I love Batman
and he won't rehabilitate them
just locks 'em up]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[gdi I realized besides Danny DeVito simply redoing the role--fucking Peter Dinklage
I feel like size is so important it's so weird it's not gonna be an inherently odd looking fellow, like kinda wrong!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Honestly judging the literary classics we read in school--there's a lot of violence and morbid shit happening

But that's different cuz it's your imagination and not directly broadcast into your brain, right
Cuz visuals matter more than imagination

... People must think this way]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Literally the confusion behind that real ass conversation btwn two cis men was "do you define a trans person by their dead gender or current one?"nso they thought a "trans woman" would be a woman who transitioned into a mannThey didn't figure it out until confirming pronouns]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'm also vehemently the anti-spoiler person who goes by spoiler rules just bc people wrongly assume spoiling something means the entire narrative no longer works, bc they've apparently never rewatched anything in their life knowing everything that happens already]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It'll never be from a good starting image cuz the apes and lions are uggo as fuck, but color coordination and theming really shouldn't be left up to a randomizer, that's like a really bad fucking idea really in terms of aesthetics]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The biggest danger being that some weirdo pervert/asshole will take advantage of this system to bully people, or they'll feel obligated and dislike the job so they bully people
And we don't want that happening to vulnerable people, or vice versa if there's some dynamic there]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[NOTE. I know I might feel different if I ever saw this mass harassment campaign happen in front of me

I was late from jump, I was reading about their apology back whenever that happened
But the lack of receipts is nuts in this case, the shit ppl are parroting each other one, too]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's not about controversy for me personally, that would only bring me attention that I'd need as a brand new creative
I don't wanna inflict this on people if it's just trash that makes an Asian person's life worse rather than better, that's my actual real world worry]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And yes, this was all while Europe was like "~oh we've banned slavery~"

Abolitionists literally boycotted sugar and other products made under slave conditions but most people kept buying stuff from the south cuz it didn't hurt their bottom line]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The real Big Big Noticeable Issue I had with psychosis was not being able to tell fiction from reality--fiction felt real, reality didn't feel real
This is a sensation. This is something you'd feel if you were in a psychedelic trip or a dream you had to wake up from, I imagine]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[and we've done them for a long time, just more natural methods--we willingly took stuff that we'd yack up just for the trip, and we'd consider it religious bc it usually feels that way even if you don't hallucinate
anyway I should sleep]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Can you imagine paris not genuinely just liking the heart glasses and she's TEASING HIM when she's like "oh I love the heart glasses"

that's way too much credit, she likes the heart glasses, Jimmy, she's fucking Paris Hilton
Or I briefly thought, fucking CHRISY TEIGEN? WEIRD]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[which means without Parenthood you don't even really have any option for sims to calm or console each other

Which
is fucking nuts
In the game that made MOODS such a big fucking deal
Like again, why add that and not add a reliable way to make sims feel better]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If characters were unhinged or silly or OTT it was bc it was good for comedy

I thought Timothy Chalomet's character captured that pathos pretty well; he's literally like dudes I've known before, just a satirical version of that so it's cranked up a bit. Not completely, tho]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[By comparison, the Ghost of Christmas Future was WAY TOO MUCH for me as a kid, oh my god]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[there's a movie about it people should go watch it's called zoot suit or smthin
it's an abstracted like dance/musical-ish? interpretation of what happened with a lot of good costuming it's been years since I've seen it I don't know how well it holds up]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's a different kind of safespace in that it's hardly a safespace at all, there's no kind of organized therapy happening, there's predators, there's people addicted to drugs and burn outs, there's people experiencing psychosis or depression on any given daynBut it's very real]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I personally abhor what the queen of rap has been up to wrt her current controversies

My take on her as a whole person is that she's unavoidably good in a genre I really adore--I also still listen to Miss Banks on occasion

Problematic favorites etc--they're hard to replace]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[By that I mean it's like--our emotions become more complex and complicated the more we truly know and are physically present with someone
we don't really know them just from chit chat on the internet, unfortunately
probably a lot of young adults out there who need to learn that]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I find it kinda... cowardly or tripe to just kill of Sirius, like Harry needs to be a double orphan, then a triple orphan when Dumbledore goes
And then you just remove all that hero worship or admiration or like... a sense of fucking guidance and go "BUT H E'S FINE, HE'S GOOD"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So one thing is the ability to listen versus the ability to rule conversation: I got taught both, my parents are loquacious stage actors, I was reading a lot, I'm an English nerd, I can go on--cis men are very different to argue with than cis women on intellectual issues]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Sometimes certain creative communities outright experience hostility from the places they exist in, like my city trying to give out tickets to street performers?
He's telling us not to self-censor
Which is weird. It's sad and silly--I can choose not to be an asshole, Kermit]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Some people don't know how scary and traumatic the coppers can be
Some people never experienced poverty to the point of not always having a ton of food
Some of us have been dealt so much shit that I feel stupid not listening to non-white ppl and not being extremely anti-racist]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[meanwhile I can imagine a horrible Two-Face plan  where he acid-burns a woman on purpose to make a Frankenstein's Wife for himself

Penguin has no such options, and I think he's stuck in a cycle of just beautiful women taking advantage (not to their detriment, he's shallow)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's almost like he only understood Dany being sexually assaulted by her brother bc he was so mean and weird about it, nevermind that they're only a scoche older than Jaime and Cersei when they started fucking
why was a parallel not drawn? I honestly don't see one drawn]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[*throws hands up* fine I'm writing a reincartion story with similar fucking themes cuz how
why
why would you make it like that
when you gave a character like Rin/Shion.... you give them the thing they needed, not the THING THEY WANTED FOR LIKE NO GOOD REASON REALLY
Kyaa &gt; Mokuren]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This lion.... had blue fur... a blue wizard hat.... doctor accessories.... and a fleshy wound on his cheek

You don't need to do this
You can generate better lions than this
why are people even validating or okay with the complete random nature of these things]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He's like a frustrated cartoon character, it's fucking perfect
It's a lot of shrugging and facial movements that's just like--he's playing and toying with us
That's what Ledger tapped into, the "I'm not freaking you out, I genuinely find this all really funny and this is fun"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Aw man. Scarecrow's been a villain for the Secret Six. Figures that's why not every villain gets to be redeemed in the DC universe: redeemed means you're fighting and get a comic dedicated to that fighting.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Simple country folks may not know wtf a vaccine is but sure as hell have seen Americans poison just about everyonennI hope this story ends with Brando pontificating on how that was their own damn fault since they're antagonists to the Vietnamese, not fuckin saviors]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And honestly given the internet's influence, I feel like people these days are more a-given to it unconsciously not realizing how alienated the other person would feel
They feel like they're being helpful or astute, they don't think they're being elitist and toxic]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Rowlette or Cyndaquil is a helluva philosophical question to posture--you can see who was immediately eliminated, no issue whatsoever, very disappointing era of water pokemon for me

I already played with Rowlette but I love him &amp; his evolution. I love Cyndaquil but he stays same]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Bc I think what those tribes get right that all modern psychology and a lot of western medicine gets wrong in general is being such an individualistic approach
