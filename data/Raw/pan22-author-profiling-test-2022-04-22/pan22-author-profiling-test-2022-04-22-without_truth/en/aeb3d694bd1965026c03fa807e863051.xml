		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My main gripe with Prometheus is that it should've had a more brooding and ominous soundtrack, kinda like Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey (which has most of the same overall vibes).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If you want to understand how the Kurdish situation in Turkey eventually escalated to where it is today, it's because the Kemalists and Grey Wolves attempted to do to them what they had previously done to urban minorities and thought it would work.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One of the most frustrating things about Russians on social media is that like the alt-right in the West, they engage in a lot of casual or passive racism, as in "Lol, I don't care about politics, I'm not a Nazi, but all non-whites are scum, lol!"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The problem with "leftists" like Caleb Maupin is that their disdain for nebulous "liberalism", which often includes basic human rights, is fundamentally anti-Western and quasi-modern, often leading them to side with fascists on many critical issues.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# And that's just Moscow and/or St. Petersburg. All the other cities, and especially the rural areas, are far worse.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It's classist to dare question the legitimacy of Amerikaans. If I want "fee" to mean "if he" instead of something you have to pay, then you best 'xept it or else.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1. China very strictly controls the movement of Uyghurs. Palestinians seldom can leave Gaza or the West Bank and blacks could seldom leave designated areas in South Africa.
2. There are Uyghurs in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They failed to predict the Soviet collapse and that's just one of their many weaknesses and shortcomings. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Thread on just how much of drama queens Serbian nationalists really are.
Remember how Israelis and Zionists reacted to Ben &amp; Jerry's last year? This is quite similar. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[When you're like me and have seen the perverse admiration that Chinese "patriots" have for not just Jews, but Israelis in particular, and their shared contempt for Muslims and left-wing Westerners, you don't buy into the attempts at compartmentalization.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# A lot of white WWII vets unironically believed the KKK and Jim Crow were on a higher moral plane than Nazism just because of vague reverence of "democratic values" and their own idiotic equations of Lincoln and Hitler.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Found it and blocked it. Looks like a fake account. Created just last November.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In western Texas and other areas of the southwestern USA where Germans settled, they prohibited guns and lived mostly peacefully, disproving the notion of the Wild West cowboy shootout world; it was white southerners who actually had that culture. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The Canadian friend whom I cut off for being racist had Polish parents and one of his best friends had parents from Russia. It was painful to cut him off because for many years, he had been my most loyal friend, but I just couldn't after Mandela died.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So talking in extremes about "exterminating fascists" even when it's a blatant byword for Palestinians, Iranians, Ukrainians, or whatever, is touted as the highest kind of moral virtue by idiots obsessed with rematches of WWII against convenient Hitlers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I blocked a Democratic politician for bragging about how great it was to work for him. Just adds to my belief that the SCDP is full of grifters.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# "OMG, we're both non-Christians, victims of racism, and have a reputation for financial success! Surely, we have to be exactly alike despite the fact we're from opposite regions on the planet!"nYeah, living that close together in a city will lead you to those conclusions.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I've seen stupid people on Twitter say nobody should ever move to the Pacific Northwest, Canada, or Argentina because "they're full of Nazis" and also say Scandinavia is guilty of colonialism and exploiting the global south.
I just...fucking...can't... 🙄😒]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One of my Russian friends just told me that the economy was so bad during the 1990s that as late as 1997, his mom was being paid in soap and pasta instead of real money.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Knowing the PRC, I would expect them to use the very original WWII plan to jointly occupy Japan as an excuse to invade and annex territories. Not that I believe they'll honestly do it, but there's not much of a "bottom" with China.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Israel puts African refugees into detention centers similar to the ones Trump puts Latinos in. I'd say that's similar enough to the present-day American south, where blacks are often tossed in jail over frivolous charges and accused of "white genocide" by rednecks. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This isn't just about Islam in France. Zemmour is also openly racist against Africans. A lot of Islamophobes conveniently leave out the fact he and LePen want to keep out black people, regardless of their religion. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We Americans used to be this way, but the Iraq War and occupation of Afghanistan (re)taught us that military force alone cannot solve problems in other countries.
Because Russia, Turkey, and Israel encourage victimhood mentalities for their citizens, they can excuse it away.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The situation is a lot more depressing than most of you can imagine. Her husband, my uncle, was diagnosed with premature Alzheimer's a few years ago and his decline has been very fast. He may not make it another year or two.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[V Gundam, which was also made in 1993, should've been a lot more like Genocyber if it was going to be so violent.
Neither really needed the gratuitous pregnancy-for-the-sake-of-tension subplots though. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA["If we declare a country to be a democracy, and they occupy a neighbor's territory after a war, they have a right to annex it if the neighbor is a dictatorship" is not a concept that 99% of people agree with, especially because of its colonial connotations.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[An interesting factoid I recently learned, one that's hard for many leftists to digest, is that the most successful farmers in early 20th Century Ukraine tended to be Germans and that the Soviets assumed all ethnic Germans to be kulaks.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That's definitely what I've figured for many years now. The USA does indeed have a lot of people who care about human rights in Russia, but a far greater proportion of them are bad-faith actors than those in Europe.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thanks to your friend Rittenhouse, if you're a suspected leftist, your neighbor or some guy on the street can shoot you out of "self-defense". 😉 #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The thing with Egypt and Syria is very much correct though, unfortunately. The Assad regime is an unreconstructed far-right one with no incentives to stop being genocidal. Egypt's government isn't quite there yet, but refuse to go far beyond Camp David.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# In the first book of my novel series, I put an explicit reference of the Texan Nazi Party leader eating Maurice's BBQ and then in the second, he has a long conversation over the phone about sauces while preparing thousands of sandwiches for a gigantic rally.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In a similar vein, if Syria were to try to take back the Golan Heights or some other country were to send troops to the West Bank, Israel would claim to have been invaded, despite the fact only a handful of countries recognize their annexation of the lands.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I still believe Leah did not receive proper medical care. Within 24 hours of her giving birth, they should've been able to monitor her and prevent any of that from happening. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Fun fact about Pamyat, I've known about them for 15 years (since 2007). I've rarely heard them mentioned since, but they've been on the West's radar for a long time, before the pro-Putin groups were established. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Don't listen to anybody on the left bashing you over this. They keep saying the status quo is needed for "the revolution", as if they would've been there to stop the guy who shot up your school or something.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The last time it happened was the Volcker Shock towards the end of Jimmy Carter's term. Reagan was able to assign all the blame onto Carter while doing things to make the recession even worse.
This is also how we end up with a second Trump term.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The Saudis once told FDR's men that the USA and Europe ought to have awarded parts of Germany to Jews if they wanted to punish the Nazis and compensate Jews so much.
This never happened in real life, although it became the plot for a real alternate history novel.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This reminds me of something. When I visited Dahlonega a little over two weeks ago, I had an awesome discussion with some potential friends and one of them asked me if South Carolina even had Waffle House. 😂 #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Laws really do not matter much in warzones at all. There's a point when political violence overwhelms a nation's court system and it just becomes a free-for-all with no consequences besides dead bodies and destroyed buildings.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# For starters, I recommend sharing this to anyone suggesting that socialists should invest any hope or faith in the Russian Communist Party, which is decisively pro-Putin.nn#URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Seriously though, y'all reactionaries in Oregon have no fucking clue just how good you have it. Y'all wanna be like Texas, Alabama, North Carolina, etc. despite living in one of the most beautiful places in the world and having a high minimum wage.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Seeing as how the Catholic Church in Ireland once rounded up pregnant teenagers to use as slaves, starting to think that may be the intention of Texas, Georgia, and Florida right now, except for adult women.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# If I were you, I'd be worried because there's a sure guarantee that AfD and their copycats will start a race to the bottom where all the parties accuse each other of anti-Semitism, "terrorism", and "fascism" to see who can be the most anti-Turkish and anti-Arab.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Russian vatniks, but especially the Putin regime more than anyone else, have incentivized a race to the bottom throughout Eastern Europe, even for the biggest Russophobes and anticommunists.
Sane people in the region know who to blame.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I actually know someone who was conscripted at age 16 after he dropped out of school and after some torture and abuse, was sent to the front lines in Chechnya.
A few reforms have been made in Russia with regards to conscription, but I emphasize "a few".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Turkish nationalism posited that although Turks did indeed originate in Central Asia, that they were blond, blue-eyed white Europeans.
Their ideas of government, legal theory, and race science came from the French and Germans.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Like, you'll have American leftists who insist the USA is the worst country in the world and side with a bunch of the countries we've attacked and sanctioned, but European anti-Americanism is much more existential. Many hate our culture, period.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# There is the red-brown pipeline though, where MLs gradually decide that Taiwanese, Uyghurs, Tibetans, and most Eastern European nationalities are "fake nations and congenital fascists" who must be deported, forcibly assimilated, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I've had a higher opinion of Argentina than of Chile for many years because Argentinians are very demonstrably traumatized by the junta and almost none want it back. Chile, by contrast, seems to have a much higher share of Pinochet apologists. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Many of these people are also Stalin apologists and defenders, who really do not care how he treated Orthodox Christians and their priests and don't seem to realize that the anti-blasphemy laws make communist ideology pre-Zyuganov basically illegal.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[His son screwed that up. The Eastern European NATO members lobbied very hard to join, although at the time, all of them had liberal, pro-Western leaders (no longer the case for Poland and Hungary).
Both Bushes did refrain from pissing off Russia too much. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I like how it reads like a Steve Jobs quote or slogan. There are enormous differences between the USA and PRC, but they're similar in banal boilerplates and soundbites.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A big problem with anti-Venezuela sentiment is that it's encouraging Latin American countries to be more like Colombia, which historically has had all of the exact same problems as its neighbor, but more acutely into the current century so far. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Tfw you've reignited the ancient French-German rivalry. I'd also add the Italians to that, but I associate them together with accordions only in the context of dancing monkeys.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I have actually seen and heard white southerners say something along these lines, along with "Them Yankees is WAY more racist cuz they got all them riots while we have more black people than they ever will!" #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thanks to one Dylann Roof clone, his mom, and literally millions of sympathizers and apologists, it's now as safe to be remotely left-wing in Wisconsin as it is to live in 1990s Croatia. 
Hell, they've already got dungeons for non-white kids.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Ignorant and stupid people, whether they be hypocritical liberals or reactionary conservatives, have an extreme desire to be morally superior to everyone else. It's from this mindset that you get American neocons, Zionists, and Russian vatnost.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Last time it got that insane was during the breakup of Yugoslavia. At least at the time, everyone acknowledged how fucked up the situation is.
With the USA, people still think NYC and LA make up for the kind of political violence associated with less developed countries.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# You libertarians are pretty open about wanting to do away with elections altogether because they're "tyranny of the majority" and "stifle liberty and markets".nHow does that make you much different from the CCP? 😏]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I finally saw the Sonic The Hedgehog movie from last year. It was pretty good. Not a single part made me laugh really hard, but it was a decent family movie that was amazingly faithful to the franchise.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I have a theory, not yet disproven, that they might already be doing this to the South Sudanese refugees and African guest workers too, but that we just haven't heard about it yet. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You can be Jewish/sympathetic to Israel and say that destroying the houses of terrorists is a good idea, but your logic can just as easily devolve into saying white Americans should evict and demolish the houses of all non-whites.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I've never seen the film and am too lazy to look up the name, but apparently, it won, like, an award or something and is significant in the history of (South) Korean animation.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I remember reading a headline about how the British Empire was founded on slavery, only to then base the ideology on anti-slavery. A somewhat similar thing can be said about the transition from the Russian Empire to Soviet Union. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[My only problem with the film is that for obvious reasons, everything is centered on just the USA, and I believe most other countries in the world would try to put more serious effort into trying to stop something like a meteor, including even Russia and China.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It is to a lot of white supremacists, which is why I know hasbarists are lying when they say they're only training American police in "anti-terrorism" and not shooting black people for sport--our cops often believe all non-whites are "terrorists". #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's been 11 years since this has been tweeted and it's never stopped being true this entire time. 😫😩 #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Not simply "pro-Russian", but also pro-Putin.

		<document><![CDATA[If a prominent professional said "Nobody listen to this black/Jew because stealing and violence are in their nature and everything that comes out of their mouths is just psychotic noise", they would very quickly be shunned by any respectable people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I would not describe Taiwanese involvement in Central America as necessarily benign before the 1990s. The KMT helped prop up all the dictatorships and death squads.
The Nicaraguan recognition of Taiwan was probably consolidated in the critical post-Cold War years.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The USA has a dangerously high population of people for whom the pandemic never happened and were almost completely insulated, physically and mentally, by 2020.
These sociopaths are still in charge of major decision-making processes in this country.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I'm all for a good "Well, akshwally..." every so often, but seeing people supposedly on my side scold and gatekeep over stuff like this is just embarrassing. 
In what context outside of satire is a family posing with automatic rifles supposed to be normal?]]></document>

I'd rather they be "useless" than ever try to impose their will on us. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[At least once, most of y'all have seen Republicans try to credit themselves and/or "white people" for ending slavery. And of course, the occasional neo-Confederate taking credit for defeating Hitler.
This is the kind of idiotic retconning we're talking about.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Emphasis on "parody" because Fidel Castro at least tried to be popular and loved whereas Lukashenko has zero charisma and doesn't care how much everyone hates him so long as he gets to keep his throne. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[This also reminds me of how there is a HUGE divide between American and European leftists. The latter are far more willing to engage in Milosevic apologetics because they are so much more motivated by anti-Americanism on a visceral level. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Putin is a "centrist" insofar that he's the most "moderate" of the authoritarians at the top of the Russian food chain. He's good enough for enough Stalinists, monarchists, neo-Nazis, Christian fundies, etc. while Navalny is not. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[What amuses me about anti-DPRK propaganda is that American conservatives seem more offended that another country doesn't like the USA than the fact it is a giant dungeon and military garrison that claims to be more authentically Korean than Seoul.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# On a more serious note, a lot of Chinese chose to invest and settle in Canada over the USA specifically because of a greater (perceived) neutrality on foreign policy issues. It's also a big part of the reason that Sagua cat cartoon on PBS existed.]]></document>

It's incredibly easy to embellish and brag about motherhood when you have the money and access to quality healthcare that they do.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[At the QT in my rural South Carolina hometown, I saw a young white lady wearing an Israeli Defense Forces jacket.
Last time I saw that on somebody in real life was on a young Jewish girl in Pikesville, Maryland.
Fucking rednecks...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[US-Russia relations didn't really sour until 2008, but shortly before that, there was the whole NATO expansion thing and Bush's justification for missiles in Poland was to protect Europe from Iranian ICBMs, not Russia's and it's very plausible he honestly believed so.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Interesting. This means that German end-use agreements are significantly stricter than the USA's, since we waive those rules for every single one of our Middle Eastern allies.
However, the arrangement isn't perfect. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It makes it slightly easier for Ohio to flip blue in the future. Critically, this is a success story in contrast with the phony effort to produce computer chips in Wisconsin that ended up being a fraud of taxpayer money for the sake of a Taiwanese billionaire. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[^^ Again, it's a race to the bottom. n"I get out my belt and chancla because I don't want my kid to be a spoiled brat/criminal/gay/liberal sissy/loser".nAnd I even see people of different races and classes justifying it to not be like people of other races and classes.]]></document>

The government has excellent relations with nearly every country except arguably China and Kyrgyzstan.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I read that one way a lot of "normal people" adapt, besides just having lots of roommates, is dealing lots of drugs, which obviously isn't desirable, but neither is the roommates thing or having the stupidly high rent in the first place. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# At least enough of us Americans realized what we did was wrong and at least tried to show the world that people of different races, religions, etc. could get along.nThe Israelis are still stuck in 1948 (and arguably before then) in terms of their worldview on race.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And also because Westerners (Germans more than anyone else since they tend to blindly support all three shitty governments in the aforementioned tweet) don't know any better. Their romanticization of the WWII victory and need to feel like heroes trumps basic logic.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In many respects this is a tragedy, but not necessarily a problem. Russia's human rights movement has to be decoupled from pro-Western hacks and cranks who are despised by the majority of the population and only respected in Washington DC. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So of course, they trained and equipped Idi Amin's military and designed and built Entebbe Airport (which really helped in foiling the hijacking).
The sudden shift came when Idi Amin asked Israel for fighter jets and missiles and they finally told him no.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is a rather blunt way of teaching children that life isn't fair. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I also learned about what the Nazis did to Jews from one of those same textbooks in 5th grade. Again, this was something our teachers never taught us at the time. Only in 8th grade did I ever have a teacher who put any effort into teaching about the Holocaust.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There is somewhat of a confidence that the weapons that Iran imports and tries to build are too crappy to pose any serious military threat to any major power, which is why the focus is on the nukes and ICBMs and exaggerations about "terrorism".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Look up how Turks are treating Syrian refugees right now. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The same theory also said that in contrast, the New England Puritan settlers, along with the Germans who passed through Pennsylvania into the Midwest, believed in a Germanic concept of freedom that was much more authentic and deeply-ingrained.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He's joking, of course, although ultraconservative and arch-reactionary types glorify the Roman Empire because they can never accept the reasons for its demise, at least reasons not involving military loss to foreigners. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The people calling for NATO to get involved with the Poland-Belarus border situation didn't say a word when thousands of Syrian refugees ended up in Turkey and were somehow less shrill when Erdogan also threatened to weaponize refugees.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I know I've compared him to Chernenko, but the Brezhnev vibes are still quite strong with the boilerplate optimism and blatant lying about the state of the country.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# That's not going to be possible so long as Lebanon is treated by the West and Arab countries as a Caribbean-style debt colony. No amount of "hard work" and financial restructuring is going to fix Lebanon.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I like how a lot of your haters accuse you of being a literal demon or vampire and this just trolls them because it also makes you a real-life anime heroine. 😉👍]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Y'all don't thank Gorby enough, imho. He was not willing to murder Ukrainians just to keep the USSR intact. Yeltsin helped too, but then saying that REALLY pisses off Putin supporters. 😆 #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The Ossetia dispute could very easily be resolved with the right kind of diplomacy and compromise. However, it's clear that it's Russia, not Georgia, that insists on maintaining the "frozen conflict", no matter what the actual Ossetians say or want.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think a lot of it has to do with a popular, though deeply flawed, false equivalence between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, something that also ties into the victimhood status conferred onto Serbia.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[When the exodus is significant enough, it can flip states blue, like it did in Georgia and Arizona. But if it's just a trickle, it just makes everyone more miserable, which is why the Atlantic Coast below the Mason-Dixon Line and right above is stagnant.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hate to talk like a Republican crank, but Democratic apparatchiks and nomenklatura are doing the exact same thing the communists did and blame their own voters for all of their problems and failures.
The GOP is delusional, but never admitting failure helps their case.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Turns out the Turpin kids were scattered across different foster families that were almost as neglectful and abusive as their biological parents.
Too burnt out to be very surprised. I mean, it was to be expected with the shitty system we have.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This reminds me so much of the US president from Idiocracy except HE actually cared about the people. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A very special happy 25th anniversary to PaRappa the Rapper for the Playstation!! 😄🎉🎊
This game has been a cult classic for almost as long as I've been alive. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# For the most part, we're not quite at British or even Warsaw Pact levels, but some places, like where there's this Walmart in West Virginia that stocked shelves with fake soda bottles, are indeed hurting.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# What pro-Putin propaganda does is misuse and relitigate events from WWII to make leftists angry and randomly brand entire European nations as "fascists". The idea is to distract you from racist, anti-Semitic, and chauvinistic Russian nationalist rhetoric.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I love how it says "hashtag antisemitism" because the guys behind MEMRI are the ones who forcibly expelled the Palestinians and they have the nerve to complain that people hate them and want the refugees to return. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Part of the reason this happened to Russia is because all the crazy exiles were allowed to come back after 1991 and this included monarchists and ethnic nationalists. Solzhenitsyn was simply the most high-profile one; there were plenty more with other funny ideas. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Everybody going "Lol, just live and work somewhere cheaper!" also doesn't seem to realize just how infuriating and difficult it is just to even rent someplace legit because of the amount of fraud, fees, screening requirements, and opacity there is.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# They also believe Japan is a futuristic utopia where everybody is middle-class, something they attribute to ethnic homogeneity and the supposed innate cultural and sometimes even biological superiority of Japanese people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# If she was REALLY from the south, she'd say "girl-child".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Bizarrely, in an interesting twist of fate, besides hillbillies still moving en masse from Pennsylvania to South Carolina, it's now also Ukrainian immigrant evangelical Christians making the Great Trek south. Few Russians among them too, but my point still stands.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Anti-Deutsche. I've already adopted a policy for blocking most Germans in Japan and/or who are spouting nonsense like this. They are hysterical racists who think they are social justice warriors.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I can assure you all that many old people view all non-whites as congenitally "lazy" and "pro-communist" and will readily sacrifice their own for the sake of not letting "them darkies" escape poverty.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Israel may be trying to use this particular militia as an intelligence asset and nothing more. Them selling weapons and surveillance tech to China gives Beijing a far bigger advantage than insincere moral support gives to Uyghurs. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The stereotype probably arose from experiences with upwardly-mobile, often politically-conservative, immigrants in NYC, LA, Philly, and Miami.
In Russia, the prerequisites for hookups and relationships are actually very low. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The English colonized Virginia thinking that they would be just like the Spanish in Mexico. Instead, the attrition rate as a result of their own violence and stupidity was so high that they only defeated the Native Americans with smallpox and continuous shipments of settlers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I think white Americans and Turks have far more in common than either would like to admit and when you spend enough time in two countries that think they're the best in the world, it can really mess with your mind.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The Hoa minority were not the reason why the French and Americans wasted so many lives and resources to prevent the unification of Vietnam. The Catholic Church was a far more powerful landowner, lobby, and CIA ally than the ethnic Chinese business owners.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Local news in South Carolina is highlighting an old woman in Hereford, Maryland who has twelve kids, all of whom served in the military.
It's for Veteran's Day, though I'm surprised Baltimore County's getting a shoutout like this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You could go as Gigan from the Godzilla movies. You just need a LOT of markers, cardboard, and duct tape though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Notice how Bolsonaro, Netanyahu, and Bennett are not included in the graphic. Obviously, Anne Applebaum has had double standards for years, but... #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You in Pennsylvania right now? If I were you, I'd hit Saubel's because they're the only store of their kind I know of with the cheap biscotti and smearcases (Amish cheesecake) they make. 🤤]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I'm talking New England WASPs, white southerners of all kinds, Mormons, and then general far-right militia types in the Midwest, West Coast, and western 2/3 of the USA in general.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[None of this should mitigate just how bad the Confederacy was, but even "good guys" in wars can be villains in their own respects.nCase in point, the British versus the Afrikaners, and then black Africans, during the Boer Wars. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Texas is quickly turning into a bad copy of pre-1994 South Africa. Not all of us want to be ruled over by racist white boomer and Gen X Christian fundamentalists, especially if we can't vote. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Churches and the white uneducated boomers and Gen Xers who attend them are one of the main reasons why South Carolina almost never gets to have nice things. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'm beginning to think that the reason so many people keep saying that Russia invaded Georgia back in 2008 is because Saakashvili had intended for it to be limited to the disputed Ossetia regions and not to result into a full-blown counterattack.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Opinion disregarded. Aaron MacLean is a consultant for Tom Cotton and claims in the article that "belief in democracy made countries fall to the Kaiser". #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Myth: Apartheid in South Africa ended the same way segregation in the USA did with enough black people protesting and the mean whites having a change of heart.
Reality: It was segregation with tanks and machine guns, ending with both the Soviet collapse and stalemate with Cuba. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The more entertaining (and infuriating) thing is arguing about this with Zionists from the former Soviet Union. With them, "indigeneity" isn't so much the point as it is "We're better than Arabs and even religious, leftist, and non-Ashkenazi Jews".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Be that as it may, remember that Britain has a lot of Pakistani immigrants who still keep in touch with their home country. And they have good reason to care about what happens in Asia, especially as it pertains to Muslims. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Like I try to hammer onto leftists here from time to time, Putin got Russians to adopt a kind of Orwellian set of mental gymnastics in which Russians can only ever be patriots, not "nationalists", who can only ever be foreigners and dissidents. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Like, I get that the USA has some of the exact same problems as Turkey and that there are far worse places, like almost every last country in Asia and northeastern Africa, but "Turkiye" isn't going to improve its reputation with someone like Erdogan in charge.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The Kim dynasty was somewhat fortunate that they had a small enough population to manage (jail and starve away) in the DPRK throughout the 1990s.
China is more like an entire country ruling over several different ones, so the scale's much larger.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Remember when Denmark said they'd start deporting Syrian refugees? They got the idea from Orban. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There's a deliberate dishonesty in wanting to teach children about the Holocaust, but then saying that discussing slavery and the mass expulsions of Native Americans is somehow "inappropriate" and "teaching students to hate the best country in the world".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The litigation of the status of the Russian language in former SSRs is a lost cause taken up not simply by mainstream nationalists, but also Russian communists, meaning that it is a deeply-rooted grievance, or entitlement rather, within their culture.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They don't even really believe in free-market capitalism because the whole idea of sanctions and embargos are an affront to that. They'll also call themselves libertarians while also saying they support bombing and invading other countries, even bringing back conscription. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[What this actually reminds me of is a MAD TV sketch where George W. Bush had his own late-night talk show and they had a Marines band play the background and cue music. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One of my Russian friends just told me he thinks that the fact one of Kyle's victims had a criminal record still doesn't excuse what he did because it's not up to private citizens to enforce the law or act like RoboCop.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# There's a tiny, but loud and obnoxious minority of them. I've noticed that they tend to be either Russian immigrants, or children of immigrants, or they are full-on alt-right and conspiracy theorists masquerading as "anti-imperialist".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think if you'd had been sent to do your LDS mission in Germany, South Korea, or Brazil, you wouldn't be saying stuff like this. White Americans are very ignorant of how many US allies actually make their own advanced weapons without depending on us. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[HUGE understatement. The only parts of rural Georgia worse than rural South Carolina are all in the forbidden zone between Augusta, Athens, and Atlanta, then everywhere south of Macon. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[CRT and the Soviet nationalities policy are very obviously not the same thing. For one thing, to this day, Russian communists cannot own up to anything the tsars, Stalin, or Brezhnev ever did and still insist ethnic Russians are noble victims.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They're not going to accept people like me. The Canadians are going to be very, very selective about who they actually grant asylum.
Realistically, I think American refugees have a better shot at getting into Mexico, the Dominican Republic...even Cuba. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The myth that Russia has never waged a war of aggression, only defensive ones, is not new either. The Soviets promoted that same narrative and it's an idea they either got from the Israelis or vice-versa (though both sides were aware, of course).]]></document>
