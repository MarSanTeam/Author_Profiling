		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So, the 2020 election, then?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The only safety precaution would be no rallies.  In this case, DJT is rushing to cull his own herd of voters.  But, he is the chosen genius. And he doesn't not care for the safety of others.  Only an adoring crowd.  Hope he enjoys.  #HASHTAG# is comin'.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# All touting campaign materials that were strangely absent from the list of tariffed goods from China, many people are saying ...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# But DJT knows more than his lawyers, people tell me.  He should be in charge.  Dems should push for that. #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# But, isn't DJT the best lawyer America has ever had in its history? Hasn't he read all the legal volumes, and told us that the lawyers don't know half of what he knows? Really, DJT, are you OK today?  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Whoever inherits this mess in #HASHTAG# will have one UGE problem to clean up and a big challenge to get America back to leader of the free world position that has been abandoned to the isolationist policies of DJT.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Don't they know that it will magically disappear soon, and that they wouldn't have found it if they didn't test.  DJT will have a snide remark later today.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# One democrat votes No, but there are 50 R senators who also voted No.  They should be just as ashamed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Appears Robertson has been speaking with Senator Collins.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# “Serve at the pleasure …”]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They will hold you in such high esteem in two weeks when many of them face 'their turn'. Then you will be ripe for lawsuits since you didn't enforce a mask mandate and caused personal injury.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Likely Ontario Premier would rather receive a lump sum from the federal government saying he’d use it for sick days, then sit on it, much like the last batch of cash, cut budgets, and put it towards the deficit.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Um, read the transcript?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Probably had a vision of himself sitting in a chair signing for days, going through sharpies ... he's very smart, you know.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# An investigation under the Republican watch.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Don't forget the debt and deficit, tariffs on China, pulling out of Ukraine, pushing Kurds under the bus, handing Turkey and Syria to Russia, pandering to KJU ... blunders far outweight what are projected as successes but simply riding Obama coattails.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Asian demand S putting pressure on US supply, leading to higher prices for gasoline and other fuels - to feed Asia.  Markets don’t adhere to boundaries.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Please go and live-tweet the event.  Try to take some pictures, too. Fawn over Vlad. I'm sure he might change his mind about a trip to 1600.  You could bring him to the sit room, let him take his phone out, and shoot some photos, too. You know, brothers. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# If DJT is unsuccessful in November, and all indications are he will fullfil that prophecy, imagine the rapists and murderers he's going to set loose on the people of the US.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Canada shouldn't be bailing out the administration on this.  They have been ripped off for too long.  Export tariffs, baby. The US can pay our farmers. #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Navarro likely thinks that, since the photo is on the internet, no one will believe it is him, and insist it is a photoshop experiment, and he never meant to take this one, but it was the only one left, but he didn’t take it, he was holding it for someone, but ... #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Not like, say, the GOP cancelling primary challenges or anything.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Trace back the supply lines for both of these companies.  Where does it lead? And so who will 'own' TikTok', or 'TikTac' as one particular leader who is very high iq apparently, calls it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Christians will crow "Well, he's honest and that's good enough for us". #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Biden wins twice.  Almost like winning a second term all at once. DJT would be furious.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Putting up a monetary wall and the US will pay for it. How very #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Republican veins would pop if Obama or Clinton said such things.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# This is kind of like the last administration that enjoyed pitting people against each other and revelling in the angst and fury.  Something about an acorn and the tree comes to mind …]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Ford neglects to mention the size of the table, which in Scottish terms is ‘very wee’ such that many things fall off the table, and therefore aren’t on the table. In his mind, he’s right. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Allegedly.  You can shred anyone over allegedly lying. Factual lying? Big difference there, Faux.  Cheap political points that continue to dissolve whatever integrity and character remains in those curls.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# A lot of the explosive trees in California are under federal jurisdiction.  Forgot to put rakes in the military budget.  #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Wonder how this impacts DJT's #HASHTAG# ?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Indeed.  And what is everyone talking about?  #HASHTAG# and not DJT.  She pulled a #HASHTAG# and misdirected everything from last night.  Who is in the spotlight, and who isn't?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You spelled "Whinery" incorrectly.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Pretty hard to identify your current occupation of the office as #HASHTAG# many people are saying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Riveting. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Why not just back out of the Chinese trade deal and let China pay tariffs to keep the farmers going?  #HASHTAG# Feels like a chapter out of econ 101 at DJT University.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Homan’s hearing appears to be quite selective, many people are saying and nodding their heads.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Chakotay would be pleased.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Time for some new caravans to approach.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# LH:  Hello, Right Hand.

RH:  Oh, hello.

LH: So, anything going on.

RH: Nope.

LH: OK, I’m sending out a letter.

RH: That’s Nice.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Most are looking for a favour later, people are saying ... but it will be a perfect fundraiser.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Lots of 'I' and very little we. Shows you who he's really fighting for, America. #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# American politics seems to have levelled off at the grocery-store checkout where all you need to know is in the entertainment shelves.  Enquiring minds want to know about tans and mocking, but not policies and issues.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The ouija board was loaned out and is overdo.  Might not arrive until Sunday, which means a decision then.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# True, but he can recall a birdie that lipped out 20 years ago for his best round ever, likely to beat Tiger Woods.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Would like to question this 'everybody' guy.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Did not know about Abbott’s anti-viral specialist background.  These politicians just hide so many of their education from us.  #HASHTAG# Hope he can fix my broken arm.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Guess COVID really is a thing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Hey, Junior ... over here.  DJT is having a moment again.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# DJT is also overrated.  I say that wearing a flannel shirt, with a tear falling down my cheek, sir. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Indeed.  So they maneuvre into their baffles and hide in the wake so they cannot be see or heard.  #HASHTAG# Sadly, doesn't work that way.  There is only one way to truly orbit.  Everyone goes the same way.  Theoretically, the US is following Russia, just at greater distance. Jeez]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Don't know why you signed a trade deal with China if you were getting free money for the farmers from them on the tariff deal.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# No.  You want authoritarianism.  You want might. You want to rule in fear.  It is not working.  #HASHTAG# is shaping up to be a doozie.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# But there’s all them shit stories in politics - you’d fit right in.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So, just throwing chocolate zucchini cake out there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Anticipating that those complaining didn’t vote.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Just in ... following this signing, a caravan of horses was gathering in South America to make the trek to the US.  DJT has approved another thousand troops to withstand their assault on the border.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# First, DJT started with the length of time the Dems took to get things going. Then, he stalls/delays/ignores. Then it is process. Now, it is time. Anyone think he's in trouble here? Rudy does, which is why he's acting strange and needs a few days off.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Interesting to see who the tariffs were initiated by and who paid them in the article.  Congratulations, US consumer, you’ve brought this on to yourself through the former guy.  Forked out the cash while TFG said China will pay for it. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# DJT will be unhappy ... something he hasn't been able to do that is the first in all of history, historical, for Republicans, you know, that whole history thing but he'll study it and have an announcement in two weeks, people tell me.  Sheesh.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The thing about a fast moving train is that it more easily comes off the rails, and then things do not end well.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# … damage the Trump presidency, likely save America from the assault on the presidency, and ultimately return constitutional standards to the presidency, like bigly.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Why not objectively examine both roll outs then allow viewers to come to their own decision? Oh, forgot, its from an opinion network.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# In a new twist Republicans are pushing a new ballot procedure where the voter can scribble all over the page and it will count as a republican vote.  Even straying outside a bubble will be interpreted as really wanting to vote R instead of D. #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Release the audio!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Mexico. Wall. Pay.  Guess not.  US. Taxpayer. Pay. Tariffs? Same.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So essentially JP is saying that bribery and corruption is a mainstay of international dealings involving the United States? #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# DJT could call him up and tell him the US is behind him bigly.  #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So the namecalling and lying stuff should be overlooked.  DJT has made his bed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The 'I just don't think' part is accurate, many people are saying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Evangelicals claimed DJT was the chosen one.  Now it's not his fault.  #HASHTAG# DJT is the true #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That's right.  Nobody would be better than Jim.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# So, when you say 'many people are telling me ...' you are making it up, right? Nobody is telling you?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So, if it is such a #HASHTAG# then get after it and prove it as such. Otherwise, quit downplaying it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Appear to be a true gotcha moment. Being a 'gotcha book' doesn't diminish the fact that it happened.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# This part is a usual tell that DJT has lost his train of thought and what he was going to say, and is trying to validate his train of thought and get back to what he thinks he was going to say.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The poor cadets. Pretty sure they don't want to hear about ventilators and tariffs and Ch-EYE-na, and never saw this coming, and only I can fix it, and those bad governors, and complete control, good and bad on both sides, and nothing encouraging them to enter this world bravely.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Surprised he hasn't crowed for 'Russia, if you are listening ...']]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It is supposed to be about the race, not you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Would that be, like, re-writing history and such? Because much patriotism was built on unsavoury practices.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Is Dr Birx sure that DJT does any analysis of the data in front of him, or do his eyes glaze over?  There are many tells when he doesn't understand something ... people are saying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Arthur had an A in coding, though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Haven’t seen it yet, but expecting the discussion to soon #HASHTAG# most of whom are democrats.  #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So the implied meaning is that he should be impeached, Dems just didn't come to their conclusion in the way he wanted.  That's politics.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Take ERdogan golfing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# One test will not negative make.  Expect daily tests for up to two weeks.  Should be in isolation too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# More legal beagles likely to get stiffed for their efforts.  But they can say they worked for the former guy.  not sure if that is a feather in a cap or a ball and chain around a leg.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Elsewhere, Florida giddy that DJT and familia are leaving New York for the sunshine State. #HASHTAG# ?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The last sentence, DonJohn in a few words - the administration is not responsible. Any bets on email reference and a perfect call today?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The kind of reporting this network and feed seem to revel in.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Surprised the right media hasn’t asked for it to be heavily redacted, because, well, you know, the right …]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Freedom is different in other countries.  It doesn’t follow you wherever you go.  There will be consequences.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Particularly #HASHTAG# this morning.  Wouldn't want to be a golf ball this weekend.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Who do you report Elder to?  This claim is suspicious.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Guess this is all about you signing, and less about the bi-partisan work to get the legislation done.  Once again, the clerk-in-chief waiting to sign while everyone else does the work.  Is the golf simulator still at the WH?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The Republican world believes the first thing they are told.  They have no ability to accept that things change.  Sure, 2 + 2 = 4 and always will be.  Living organisms, like a virus, changes and adjustments made based on science.  It is likely why Rs can’t get a new leader.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Guess DJT was on the wrong drugs and his earpiece wasn't working.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Now Faux is getting into meddling in military procedures? An entertainment network?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# US policy in the twittersphere.  Sadly #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The new republican mantra #HASHTAG# should be another nail in the #HASHTAG# coffin.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# And nothing about soup, toilets or showers, people are saying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Thought 2016 wasn’t about rigging elections?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Durham probe to many on the left is so Jan 6th to many on the right.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Ah, disappointed in the rule of law, the constitution, and the will of the people. Doesn't sound like a democratically elected leader, many people are saying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Many crystal balls suggest a great recovery in January 2021, largely based on the new resident at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# All the effort put into re-opening guidelines, DJT backs GA in contravention of the guidelines, and it's all out open up.  As he is fond of saying, we'll see in 2 weeks. We'll have something in 2 weeks.  Hoping to god it isn't catastrophic.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So, um, has the recession and job losses hit yet?  Because DoFo said it would.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The PEOPLE of the US will bring this back.  DJT is just culling the herd in the name of opening the country, it seems, and will be a bystander when recovery begins.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Guess Russia had all their 286s on Thursday night trying to help with the ratings numbers.  #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# DJT has done everything to split this nation apart. Offended many. Now wants them to do his bidding? Come on.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# But at what cost ... ?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Arsonist adding fuel to the fire.  And then blaming other parties.  Not the president of the US, only of about 1/4, if he's lucky.  One small mark in #HASHTAG# can put an end to this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# "That's what I hear" ... anonymous sources that he so blatantly disbelieves are now quite credible when he hears them?  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# *'doing it over twitter']]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# DJT doesn't believe him, and thinks he is much smarter.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Just wondering if they are DJT appointed, or does he have another Obama excuse here?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# When it should be about a wedding, it's about DJT.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# He’s free to do that, but doesn’t have a pardon in the wings hence the suit.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Maybe those caravans (which we haven't heard of for a while) of rapists and murderers are coming to the US to get pardons ... people tell me. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Quite likely to continue into the next few months, and perhaps years.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# More reason to celebrate are the numerous law suits on voting irregularities being dropped. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# "I-yi-YI" pretty high on himself today.  Thank goodness Donald J Trump is here to save the universe with his uge words and bigly message, so big that he can walk in on naked teenage girls and no one says a thing, people tell me, and everyone reports on it ... #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Wonder when he's going to apply the loyalty test to them?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# A clock running counterclockwise is just a clock. REal change would be to go to a base 10 timepiece, for instance.  Like going from British to metric measurements. That hasn’t gone as anticipated.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Finally, something we can all agree on. An embarrassment to the USA to continue after the 50th loss. DJT is making the US a laughing stock.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Imagine, a president can be bought.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# DJT taking care of the evangelicals, in the biggest tax haven in the history of tax havens.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So all this ‘stop the steal’ rhetoric from DJT shouldn’t count, because it was the people who chose to resort to violence. In legal terms, should DJT ‘ought to have known’ saying such things would result in violence? Seems to be the standard in a courtroom. Oh, right. Not court.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Tariff on Mexican goods, to get them to pay for it, just like China is paying the farmers. What's that? Consumers pay the tariffs. But they are perfect tariffs. Read the tariffs. They are perfect. There is nothing wrong with them. #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# She's been around DJT long enough to pick up his verbiage, or not pick it up, but pick it up in a good way, if it was possible to pick it up, but whether it is picked up or not picked up, its' beautiful and very strong and there will be a report on it in two weeks.  Thank you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Certainly a delay, after the initial offering went to big corps that DJT had to walkback and ask them to return their money.  And those are just the ones he knows about.  Lots will be ducking to keep their cash.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# DJT: "I didn't shake any, because I have one shake for certain people, and a non-shake for others, and so I was non-shaking the hands of certain people and most of them were non- so I didn't, but we have a very good relationship, and strong, beautiful, but not shaking hands."]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Except you aren't running against all four.  So, move the support to the democratic candidate and all of a sudden .. well, you can attempt the math.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# When these superspreader events create havoc in the health sector in the next six weeks, who will be the great guy?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# DJT would claim to be the most transparent president in the history of the world for using an unsecured device, so no, it isn't a problem because anyone could listen to his perfect calls. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Just 15 hours ago, you said 'we need to work together' then you quote Faux with this? #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Is that the drugs you are on talking, or is it you?  As things are experimental, one must wonder. The US is in a fragile predicament.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Condemn it all, but have no answer to negotiating an end to it?  Condemnation is fine. REaching a solution is hard, and right now politically expedient to ignore.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Over 180K dead, too. From something you could have prevented. Running from CDC, WHO and various scientific groups to huddle under tin hats is unbecoming a president who has done more to reduce the influence of the US in the world than any other leader in history.  #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse ...]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# But ... but ... but ... it was onlly one case, maybe 15 and it would go to zero miraculously and disappear, with a little bleach for good measure, and then magically &lt;&lt;UGE hand flourish&gt;&gt; it will be gone and we'll wonder, what was that? #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Likely a few tweaks to the ACA, and a renaming to the USDJTCA and it will be the first of its kind in history and the best that anyone could have ever hoped for, and no one would have believed it could have been done, it will be beautiful, that's a beautiful name. #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Outright call to have votes overturned.  There's a word for this ... and it is right out in the open.  The system touted around the world thrown into chaos by its leader. This is so so sad for democracy and America.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Whatever happened to not telling them what you were planning to do?  You were quite indignant with former administrations saying what was coming.  Why do you always seem to negotiate internationally via twitter?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Were they all marked "Trump" ... for mayor?  #HASHTAG# when a president accuses his country of fraud, when he should be promoting fairness and encouraging people to vote using appropriate means.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# She was getting no exposure on the private network DJT put her in. So, she's moving to a position that, well, hasn't had a public gathering in over a year.  That's a step up. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
