		<document><![CDATA[But yeah: shine a gigantic fearmongering spotlight on the (perceived, in this case) men, sideline the (again, perceived) women as much as possible except as brainwashed victims to be saved.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Part of the reason I find myself repeatedly coming back to the show High Guardian Spice is that for an adolescant crowd I think its rep is about the best that is possible from studio funding, and it comes up short and it got eaten alive by the cryptofash wolves]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It's wild how much they think pointing out the furry thing is an own. Like yeah dog I picked my banner on purpose, good job sleuthing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# And again I do have sympathy for that reading it's just that I'm starting to feel like it's more pernicious than anyone's realized]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is why writing fiction where you just randomly make people gay and it doesn't come up straight up doesn't work by the way, because it in effect normalizes the existence of queer people who are not allowed to talk about their experiences being queer, let alone have insight]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Oh my god I just remembered they made parallel-Rose Romani in the movie. And then I remembered the everything else about Rose in that anime. Jesus. Reminds me of that FF7 fanfic I found as a teen set in Auschwitz where Cloud was a guard and Tifa was an imprisoned Jewish woman]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I think I somehow hit the sweet spot of clueless liberalism to make them maximum clueless. Both afraid to make presume, yet assured they know all there is to know]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Strong argument for the funniest BM episode (wiki summary category).
"What if a hashtag... UNLEASHED BEES!!!"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I had a zero-interaction thread about this earlier but like: any community that is predicated on you making money and has at minimum an $800 buy in is at best gonna be rife with charlatans.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's almost like the fucking shoe-locker exclusivism is primarily an invention of a misguided attempt to try and map out the human condition unique to western pseudo-science or something #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also an out-of-context moment in Baki the Grappler.
Everything about the prison arc is the best thing but the setup and inciting incident is the best of the best things #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[(long story short my grandfather was in the navy during WWII and came from extreme poverty so he left a massive RESP for all his grandchildren. So it was more dignified for my parents to ship me to some barely-legal private school grades 5-7 than admit I had autism)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# This show is YA to hell but it does some legitimately extremely cool things with how it manages tone that while not new, I think have become much more rare in the last few decades even in the anime it clearly takes a lot of DNA from]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'm like 40% this was the plot of one of the filler Animorphs books]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Same cycle was used in The Aristocats, if memory serves. So it's double-furry]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Honestly I think part of the reason Tales of Legendia had the story that stood out to me the most is that they didn't try and explain the whole world and they just narrowed it down to an extremely boss high-concept setting (warship the size of a country that came from space)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# We’ll time to officially refer to myself as pan sexual I guess]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Seriously, when you're doing advanced math the last thing you want to do is get an equation wrong on a stupidly simple mistake so you just use your calculator for risk reduction. It got to the point I was the only one in my friend group who could do a 15% tip in my head]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Like as a music genre or an aesthetic (eg cottagecore)? Because I can see the latter just by closing my eyes, it's uncanny. It looks like a purposefully undefined city skyline quicky intersped with nature that could come from anywhere and twelve-frame cuts of a Native ceremony]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I like the intro to Paranoia Agent. Just a bunch of cool folks laughing their cares away, not a care in the world. Very wholesome!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# When you win a revolution you get to respec into any character you want]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I get the impulse but I know a lot of trans people who self-identify as straight and are glad to do so. You learn to get over the false dichotomy pretty fast.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Thinking of the time Kropotkin was talking with two much younger communists, and he said that and asserted that sex wasn't usually on the minds of true communists. They went "you're just saying that because you're old" and he went "actually yeah, fair point" #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The dude got culturally outflanked by Zac Snyder so hard it's probably going to get detailed in dubiously ethical books over the coming years]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# For a bit I did a summary of Aladdin and realized that in terms of general feminist structure it's basically an identical story to Snow White or Sleeping Beauty with a fresh coat of paint]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Game is still an incredibly lovely joy but if I'm being real using the tilt controlls to replicate the WiiU touchscreen just doesn't work. Especially since if I'm being real the WiiU's tilt controlls were better than the Switch's are]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You know the "too recent" comment almost raises my hackles more than the "too political" one. Like, damn the dude really wants a safe distance in his dabblings into the mysticism of the other. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Starting article from scratch to try and narrow the scope, have retitled it "The assassination of inclusive representation by the coward neoliberalism" if you want to guess the general mood of it]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It remains in essence the first and only time I've truly felt *seen* by a work of art on that front. It doesn't shy away from the sketchy history and where communism is at right now but it makes its declaration of why I could never be anything else all the more beautiful]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You ever read a plot synopsis and have to just kind of sit down and let a joyously quiet-minded serenity flow through you? #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I have seen some pushback for this (because terfs are inherently reactionary and either go for really basic symbols or flock to whatever fad is currently going on they've basically abandoned it) and it rules that we're reclaiming it, even if I personally hate the colours #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There are a handful of artists that do actually want you to treat their works like puzzleboxes, to varying degree of success (I like Book of the New Sun a whole lot I may have mentioned this) but people are confusing basic subtext with "we got a mystery to solve, loyal fans!" #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The post-credit scene did two very important things to establish that the mood was set to get a whole lot darker in a 2nd season (please god) and beyond the obvious spoiler one, equally important is showing in-universe that yeah, Mandrake is in fact a complete loser dink]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I dunno, if I linked the science fiction novel my dad wrote would anyone be interested? I promise the first one is actually well above average YA sci-fi, if written by the most boomer man that has ever lived. Makes it stand out, at any rate.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[My funniest childhood memory is when I was eight and for an assignment for school we had to choose a song and were told "don't do rap, that has swears in it" and the only rap song I knew was the DK rap and I thought to myself "oh yeah that does have a 'hell' in the last verse"]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Replaying Banjo-Kazooie after having hit thirty, I must state that Gruntilda is a fucking mood]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Oh I meant the initial Terra arc in s3. I don't think it's a coincidence the Slade-less seasons (2 &amp; 5) are considered the weaker ones.

Hell even fans of the comic, given Deathstroke's current run were going "yeah it's nothing like the comic but also it's just flat-out better"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Honestly having a cis half-sister who was way into the whole natural-bodies body positivity scene when I was 13 or so has done an awful lot to curve a lot of common dysphoria triggers. Turns out bodies just do a lot of things and the shame of hiding them is toxic!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I've talked at length about how being trans in public is to walk a very very thin tightrope where any deviation will cause cis people to get extremely mad at you for daring to exist in a way counter to what they were told to expect and tolerate.
