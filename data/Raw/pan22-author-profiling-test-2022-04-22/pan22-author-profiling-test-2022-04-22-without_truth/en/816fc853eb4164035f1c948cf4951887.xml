		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That would suggest that stagflation is already here. I wouldn't suggest it's deflationary. If you look at the 1970s, inflation continued to go up well after the economy had slowed down and I suspect the same will happen here. Worst of all possible worlds.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I think that's a very important insight and I don't think it's properly reflected in the arguments pertaining to the alleged labour market slack (which I personally think is gone - Long Covid is another reason for that).

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Maybe but why is consumer credit up? Seems we are getting the worst of all possible worlds. In the 1970s, inflationary pressures continued to build well after the recessionary pressures started, especially as wages in real terms aren't going up, which will add to the pressures.]]></document>
