I correctly referred to the only specific case of a judge “compelling speech.”

You came in screaming about rape.

I asked you to tell me what case you were yelling about.

You don’t know. You’ve just seen yelling. Maybe JKR said something? Regardless, it’s my fault.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# We go by self-ID. As the second study I cited shows, self-ID does not result in an increase of cisgender men claiming to be women. Are you proposing we double check people’s genitals at the door?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Meat Loaf’s persona, right down to naming himself after an object, is deeply queer and deeply non-binary. He created a *performance* that read as queer to many of us on the gender spectrum, which has been meaningful regardless of his actual relationship to queerness. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That’s horrible and disgusting. I’m sorry your life has meant you had people saying this shit about you from a young age. I hope your advocacy will mean future trans kids don’t have to go through the same shit.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But GCs don’t like that argument and argue against future cases, saying that the normalization of self-ID (believing that a person is who they say they are) opens the door for cisgender men to prey on vulnerable populations of cis women.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[An early draft of IN TRANSIT had a section with thoughts on Meat Loaf as a non-binary image, but I cut it because I thought it would go too far off in a tangent about stage personas. Now I wish I’d kept it!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There’s the obvious problem with that, in that in areas where self-ID has been the law of the land for decades (like Minneapolis, where I live), there has not been a rise in cisgender men pretending to be trans in order to access women’s spaces. It’s just provably not a thing.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I would need evidence that the latter category even exists, because cisgender men have never needed an excuse to enter women’s spaces, and trans self-identification has not changed that.
