		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Despite everything that was thrown at them because there were loads of people willing to fight for it- (and get themselves hurt in some cases) I think Labour picked up 5 or 6 points in the campaign. They don't have that line of defence this time.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The delusion of thinking the Labour right are going to help any alliance like that too. They're fucking jackals who hate each other- they fucking hate Lib Dems and Greens who they think are bearded hippies on bicycles who don't like war and putting people in prison enough.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We could see Labour running Smethwick 1964 style campaigns to try appeal to white voters next time. I'm really not sure I'm exaggerating there, these people are so deeply Islamophobic (and racist in other ways) that I think they'll think it's a good campaign tactic.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It's an antisemitic act in my view. It is an act deliberately designed to prevent a Jewish woman participating in democratic politics, and doing so by deeming her right to speak on her own history as unacceptable. These things are chilling.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It is really weird how the genie is out of the bottle on a lot of issues, that the politicians can't exactly make it totally go away, but they can devise endless traps and tortures for it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# We compromised on the referendum, more coppers, nuclear weapons, candidate selections, welfare policy in 2017, there's probably more]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# What I don't get is that people are also crediting him for talking to Wakeford over the defection as well as supporting Corbyn getting the whip back, voting RLB and when you saw him doing the media under Corbyn it usually meant they were feeling defensive af on Brexit.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is literally what Corbyn did for the majority of his leadership. Which had some impact in 2017. But ultimately the same people running the Labour party now absolutely refused that compromise at the time. #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They were looking for anything they could pin on Rashford, weren't they? Has that air about it that they just looked and looked until inevitably there was a story they could just about spin out.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Fair enough. What he represents is very frightening. Especially if you also had to deal with his legacy from the NUS, which you might have done? He's one of the most dangerous people in politics right now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# He's protected his tweets now. Which is fine, if a backlash gets intense I can understand it. Problem is, people like this will pretend strong disagreement with their dog shit politics is abuse, even though they would feel free to be all sorts of bigoted and not expect challenge.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Yeah, they always let themselves be set up like this though so it's hard to feel sorry. They don't learn and it isn't as if it's a secret.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# This is extraordinary. Framing his death as being caused by twitter users being antisemitic is so dishonest, it is really quite vile.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Embarrassing for the so-called party of Labour. Do you think they're going to do anything for your pay and conditions if this is how it is for their own staff? #URL#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[And this is just the notable incidences of Islamophobia. The party still has huge issues with other bigotries against different marginalised groups: GRT people, black people, Jewish people, trans people, and there's even an ugly misogyny right at its core.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You're fucked if you respond to that as well. If you follow them inserting Israel without any need, you'll be the one accused of conflating Israel and Jewishness. If you ignore it, they'll just say it proves you hate Jews.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# There's nothing that isn't considered an opportunity for those like Freeman to use that horror, to reduce those memories and the real continued impact they have into their wretched game today]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The way Zarah Sultana (and other ethnic minority MPs, especially women) have been treated by Labour on a personal and professional level is foul. This is also symbolic of their wider racist and white supremacist attitudes. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Boasting about it even though I'm pretty sure that is a total lie in itself. They literally invented a narrative just so they could boast about Islamophobia]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I think there are a range of issues where Labour would be keen to outflank the Tories to the right to try impress right wing media. I would think bigotry against certain groups already targetted by those media outlets... (Muslims, trans people, black people, GRT people)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I believe they've changed their terms since then as well.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I wonder if some like Jess, or the younger and/or ethnic minority left MPs who bear the brunt of the abuse or even Jeremy Corbyn himself ever feel like they aren't exactly being inundated with support by senior and influential left wing figures.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Where they go, enough people will follow that essentially it doesn't matter what people who don't follow think, and indeed they should also follow. Ultimately, it's an argument for centre right and right wing hegemony drowned in false acceptance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I remember being lucky enough to go to Camp Nou in 2005 and seeing a little guy called Lionel Messi I'd never heard of light up the place. Now, you have to make do with seeing oiled up Adama Traore. What a drop off.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# There was a chance there could be a very weird Tanskii cult going on]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The list could go on. Apsana Begum is at severe risk of physical violence, on top of whatever has been done to her mental health, and I think we can all see that the Labour party is encouraging this in its silence.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Can be expelled but someone rooted in Tory party activism can come straight on in! And be welcomed straight into the hierarchies of power! That's who they are though, they keep demonstrating it. Maybe, just maybe we should get the message?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Are you saying Islamophobia isn't treated seriously in UK politics and that lots of politicians actually encourage it?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Right wingers trying to play victim when they're the aggressor? I am shocked! Absolutely shocked!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I know he was on once for a debate on it with Blakeley who I assume was arguing a lexit position?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yet that was so obviously so many people saying "this is the compromise" and they were given yet more aggro and abuse on top of the systemic challenges oppressing those groups. Absolutely no-one should be telling them about the need for compromise or holding their nose.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Same with how they really went for Dua Lipa with that full page ad and because of how big she is, she was literally able to double down and cite B'tselem. No chance a politician could have done that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Deliberately so. In the short term, I think they're all trying to make the Islamophobia stuff go away because they're all deep in the shit with that. More widely, the way that the media and most political actors have approached the parties stuff is...]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# As I am a Leeds fan... I'm not sure the issue there is the entirety of Turkey. Other teams do exist than Galatasaray. I mean, Leeds fans should probably remember beating Besiktas 6-0]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Ha ha ha imagine desperately wanting to be a staunch ha ha ha]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Losing my temper at this latest round of parties bollocks because they're all basically laughing at us as they make it about the Westminster circus and all desperately avoid making it about what the Tories have actually done which has done so much damage.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# When he saw it would be helpful politically while demonstrating a willingness to either turn a blind eye to or low key encourage anti-black racism. He's also been put in the health brief as a clear sign to private health that Labour won't fight privatisation...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine 🎵]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Are you a left winger? No. So this thread isn't really for you. Labour's vote still went over the course of the campaign in 2019, but sure having loads less people enthusiastically campaigning for Labour is brilliant- let's see how it goes!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yeah, that's a proper Labour mindset right there. You "fix" things. As long as the illusion can be maintained, it makes you the good guys in Labour land.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# They are going to get someone prominent seriously hurt and they're going to laugh about it. Bear in mind how we don't really have a sense of the damage on people's mental health from being around these people. There is nothing they will consider beyond the pale.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[These guys always argue "think of the children, it might hurt their tiny eyes" but then they start crying about kids knowing asexual people exist and it just gives away how bigoted they are. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It is absolutely true that the Tory party is an Islamophobic cesspit. But any moralising on the subject of Islamophobia from a Labour MP is hollow and frankly appalling, especially considering how your party treats its own Muslim women MPs...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It is also entirely cynical though. I don't for one moment believe he cares at all about the racism Ghani has been subjected to. He's calculated he can use it for his own gain whereas that isn't so in other cases.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[These aren't new questions for left wingers though. Indeed, this is exactly the stuff we argue among ourselves about constantly. While it looks like Hundal might be merely asking those same questions on the surface, that isn't quite what's happening...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Baulk at doing so when there's a real ballot box- North Shropshire being a good example of that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That's a Tory template. Also, doesn't look like they ventured into the town itself to speak to anyone, wonder why...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is truly horrific. People having their lives reduced to cover stories, being open and vulnerable not knowing they were exposing themselves to someone who essentially wasn't real. It's appalling #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Are the SNP literally just going to pretend she isn't at this forever? #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They are lying about the financial situation they were left. We don't know exactly where that £13million has gone. With this level of either incompetence or corruption, they should not be near running the economy. What would they do with public money??]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I don't want to be overly confrontational about it, I just can't honestly believe Labour are going to be sympathetic on these issues when elected officials are behaving like this and it's an attitude that I feel is important to highlight]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Ha ha ha. The British press basically knew about this the entire time. I expect you wouldn't have got a complete culture of silence from the American press if it was Trump, that's how far gone the British press is. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think something that isn't really discussed enough is that there are plenty of people from marginalised and minority groups who joined Labour and campaigned for it enthusiastically under Corbyn even though they surely never thought they would after New Labour.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# We all know the Labour right wants rid of Sultana already, we don't need another anonymous briefing story to tell us that. This is clearly an attempt at "disciplining" MPs who don't fall into line, targetting racial minorities from the Labour right.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# These people are going to get someone seriously hurt (And I'd say Jess was as likely as most) and then laugh about it. They're just beyond vile, some of the worst people going]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The way that transphobia has been indulged or ignored by Labour makes me frightened. That's not to say I think the Tories are anything other than an unadulterated negative. I just can't trust Labour either, especially after the way they've behaved just this week.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I strongly believe these people are as dangerous as Conservatives. And that's not me underestimating the Tories. The Tories are one of the most dangerous political movements to have ever existed. But I can't pretend I'm not as frightened of Labour on trans rights and much more.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Being the most Blairite of the Blairites coupled with the fact he's clearly extremely well connected in the media on its own makes him dangerous.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Wakeford voted to give the Home Secretary the power to take away the citizenship of six million people, including British Jews. While you might feel confident that power might not be used on you now, the prospect it might one day is absolutely horrifying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They should be bright enough to realise that the horror of those murders by Galatasaray fans doesn't taint an entire country. The Besiktas game I mention was only a few months later and is part of *that* champions league run, I don't think there's an excuse tbh]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I feel so personally targeted by this cunt. Had I gone to uni straight away, I'd have been in the first year of 9k fees and this cunt sold us out.

I'm really quite pleased to get a response where someone is concerned about an issue like this, god knows that isn't what usually comes back.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I don't even know it's worse. Different objectives perhaps, but same vile racism ultimately]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# A bunch of clichés, sneering and bits of wishful thinking that shows that these people still haven't learned that the North of England is not one solid mass of old white men who worked in a factory or a mine 40 years ago who definitely all voted Labour except under bad Mr Corbyn]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Ah yeah, I do remember this particular bit of analysis. What those fools missed, even in their own argument, is that the Independent called themselves "Heavy Woollen", a heavily local reference and I expect that's the basis on which they got the majority of their votes.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yeah, it's a lot easier to stay if you're white, and let's face it male and straight. The amount of prejudice in that party means anything other than that and your existence is itself a way of them being hostile to you]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# As for writing to David Evans about protecting racial minorities- good luck. No, seriously, Labour is going in a very racist direction lately with Evans at the helm.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think it is important to be open about what this situation demonstrates in terms of the people we're up against and what they're prepared to say and do. Jess seems to be one of the main targets of right wingers and centrists for smears and abuse...]]></document>

How can it be reasonable to pretend you really care about antisemitism, and demand no-one question that, when that's your attitude?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# But also that the concerns and opposition of racial minority communities to their communities being cut up by the very same people are terribly irrelevant, not worth consideration, and there's a nasty undercurrent that getting rid of racial minority groups from an area...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# What film needs to be 3 hours long though?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yeah, he's been pretty loyal to the Tory whip and there's been no demonstration of any changed views.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is what NHS privatisation looks like. Just because they're doing it in a very opaque way rather than "if you see Sid, tell him", it doesn't mean it isn't happening. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It is fortunate Rashford is so famous through football really, this kind of attack probably won't end up doing too much damage to him personally. But what it legitimises as an attack on black people more widely is disturbing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yeah, that's also the bit I'm less sure about.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is the same person who theatrically performed discussed when someone she didn't like in her party called Boris Johnson a liar not too long ago. These people would tell the fascists where you were hiding. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4) There is very little attempt to link the fact that the Tories had parties while effectively murdering thousands through covid in Britain while also effectively murdering non white people at sea. There's a real link here displaying their attitude whose lives have value.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# You keep pretending they'll do anything the Tories won't.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# A useful tactic the "kind and gentle" hard left are developing these days...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Many of them still using this to gloss over drowning non white people in the channel.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# "Well done Labour, you're back to being the authoritarian white supremacists that I, as an ardent EU supporter, can get behind"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# And even then, he doesn't care about Rayner. Look at how his people were briefing against her for what she wore or how she speaks. Rayner is certainly higher in the hierarchy than Abbott, Butler, Begum, Sultana, well anyone not white really.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Remembering all those types trying to say that Peterborough was a vote for a people's vote when it was literally people door knocking that saved it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Considering the Labour right were driving this bogus prosecution, I'd have to say that the leadership would have been quite disappointed when she was acquitted.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I feel like maybe it's a waste of the strength in your soul to deny yourself being a cool album cover photo more often.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Normal QTs on this one. Not actually putting together any practical criticism of the idea but just "hur dur hard left TROTS" and whining that Labour MPs might have to listen to someone else for once in their lives.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This abuse from people who demand to be recognised as the only legitimate authorities is so disgusting. Sorry to anyone who is on the wrong side of this cynical shit. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yes, he demonstrates that the values of a centrist are very much aligned with the far right on most issues, as are the values of those running the Labour party.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I don't think he's antisemitic or that he has anything to apologise for beyond the apology he has already made. I guess though isn't for me to decide that or accept that apology, but it is what I think the truth is.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Need a proper sauce. Get the gravy and the cheese on there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Whoever this is has been a long term huffer of industrial glue]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They were retweeting that sanctimonious ex Barnet Council Islamophobe, very  🚩🚩🚩 for me]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It isn't though. That's the logic of saying Wakeford is acceptable as a Labour MP but Corbyn isn't. Why should anyone remotely progressive get behind people who openly demonstrate this?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# And the only pressures that have any consequences for anyone are pressures to go further rightwards because they've always controlled so much of the overall structures of the party, either formally or informally.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This was Labour's attitude to Muslims in Batley six months ago. Don't believe any of those bastards when they perform outrage today. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I think some communities (with large ethnic minority populations) will be policed very heavily under greater regulations. Genuinely expecting people to be handed fines for sitting on park benches again]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My memory of that was that he was very apologetic and then someone dug it back up again after?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He's a racist to Muslims, black people and GRT people so of course this guy is happy. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Ha ha, he seems to have hit Bastani's list today, so we might get some fun out of that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Would limit the Brewdog fund though]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Socialism is when you willingly work for free for capital. I am very smart. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Still not the most racist ad I've seen. That's probably either the Ribena "black currants" or the Esso advert with racial stereotypes of Indians and Chinese people]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And yet I failed to mention that Keir Starmer hired Phil Collins as his speech writer who wrote articles about "the Muslim question" #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I still think an election campaign will sink Kieth. Between his awful persona, Labour's dire finances and the fact that they've pissed off most of their campaigning base- I think they'll crumble in a campaign]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I don't at all wish to speak for them, but one can only wonder at the scale of disillusionment they must feel and it must be constant as well. Maybe it happens privately, but you don't necessarily see allies publicly rushing to their defence or standing with them either.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He has merely calculated that being seen to be against Islamophobia is not as important as being seen to be against antisemitism, and talking about Islamophobia is less useful to him than talking about antisemitism.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# A lot of anti sex work arguments seem to revolve around not supporting sex workers and putting them in greater danger.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[(Although of course we all know many of them worked against Corbyn and that the efforts came from powerful positions within) or many socialists and social democrats who have either been expelled or driven out of Labour.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# You wouldn't want another minority group, say a racial minority, entirely demonised because of something like this. If journalists are going to report something like this, they need to do it carefully and accurately, unlike this piece, or it puts people at risk.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Depends what you mean by dunk. Don't think this one needs for a silly pic or gif, but you can still talk about how these grifters are relying on people taking them at their word in order to spread fear.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Taiwo Owatemi, hardly even a left winger, was hit by one of these deselection briefings shortly after she openly defended trans people and advocated for trans rights in parliament. So it isn't just a problem with Muslim MPs, even if we are focusing on Islamophobia now.]]></document>
