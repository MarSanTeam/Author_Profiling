Like, if someone refuses to gender me correctly, is that mere political disagreement? What if they support concentration camps? What if they believe that civil rights protestors being killed by vigilantes is good?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I think it honestly has more to do with having a character limit. But the thing in question is that Sophie repeated long debunked, never substantiated in the first place "sex cult" accusations about a content creator she dislikes in a really performatively cruel way, basically.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Oh my gosh it's true, it's mind boggling]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I think it's possible to sensibly identify someone as not anarchist, but in this case in my personal opinion they're more like poorly informed anarchists. They seem to generally hold anarchist beliefs, they just also believe some very dumb stuff and don't know a ton.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #URL#

So I think there's a lot of problems with the idea of a planned economy, the kind of logistics you're talking about is super fascinating and I think can be applied beyond the limited ideas of centralized planned economics folks mostly talk about now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In a way I think it's kind of an interesting look into the propaganda mill; what you can see here is this nascent, self-referential fear. *Something* is being stolen, they're sure of it. It's really silly, but it also goes along with getting people to believe worse stuff.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I've been curious about it because I care a lot about queer liberation and it sounded really fascinating, and so far I either super don't get it or it's just a whole bunch of actually pretty awful nonsense disguised in radical aesthetics.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# This just isn't true; reactionary sentiment can't be collapsed to a single vector like that. Fascists hate queer people for a variety of reasons, from their arch-patriarchal worldview to just plain old disgust. While these things were intertwined, it's not causal like that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Riley Grace Roshong is the definition of an assimilationist, from her sex panic nonsense, to her contempt for a variety of gender identities, to her respectability politics, to her cultivation of assimilationist allies like Kalvin Garrah and Gami. 

Here's one of her manifestos. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I'm a wobbly and I think the IWW has a lot of value right now; I think solidarity unionism provides a lot of opportunities to build aid in other ways and connect parts of communities that might not otherwise be connected.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I can only imagine, I hope you're staying as safe as possible. I'm in a safer part of a pretty safe state honestly, but I still worry about stuff from the federal level. Well, I guess being visibly trans has definitely made dealing with cops less pleasant, but generally safe area]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Luna Oi? The woman who engages in apologia for the ongoing ethnic cleansing of the Cham? Who said that queer radicals in her favorite states were a color revolutionaries? The authoritarian who directs people to harass Vietnamese radicals that dislike the state? You sure?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# If a person is at risk of immediate grievous harm or death and the only thing you can reasonably do is call 911, you should. Weigh it against the extremely serious risks obviously, and avoid calling 911 whenever possible, but there's just not another option sometimes.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I think I understand where you're coming from, but at least in my experience people who haven't lived in the US are often really surprised about things like the extent of our prison slavery, or the omnipresence of cops. Like, not arguing that the US is the worst or anything.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Workers, the *people* of the Soviet Union built the factories, they fought and died in the Great Patriotic War, they beat the Nazis. Stalin oversaw campaigns of terror, ethnic cleansing, imperialism, and suppression of radicals.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# If you'd ever like to share I'd love to read some!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Oh my gosh, why would you link that if you were going to make things up? Lol, that's spectacular!

No, if you look at the survey it doesn't say anything close to what you say it does. Support for self-id is high; people support post-op trans folks using correct gender facilities.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Pallas is an epithet of Athena, and also 2 Pallas is an asteroid that's home to a major Awaken settlement in the Destiny lore. Riot because we all should. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# But obviously we *do* care about things like context, patterns of behavior, avoiding false positives and whatnot. Someone can do something bigoted without being ideologically committed to bigotry. Cay engaged in bigoted behavior; pretending she's on the scale of Angel is wrong.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# First of all, "in youth"? Second of all, good point, let's get on it]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Stalin was a vicious anti-Semite, he helped orchestrate the dispossession of indigenous people across Russia, he presided over a unitary totalitarian state that year on year got more repressive under his administration. You don't, under any circumstance, gotta give it to him.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# So in simple terms, it doesn't matter to me if abortion is killing a person or not, I think that's a red herring. Even in a scenario like Lapis proposed where there is a hand-waive alternative to abortion that equally respects autonomy I'm not sure that really matters?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Also, you made your comment in response to Chinese anarchists talking about something. Like, this is very much you having an opinion on what is best for Chinese people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The reason why AFG wielding the state against antifascists is so beyond the pale is because of how unbelievably scattershot and blunt the state is willing to be. Read about the Green Scare, or state repression following any movement; the state will trawl through 1/-]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# They're not even "overly represented" honestly; people are just focused on them right now because some debate brained weirdos made a thing of it. Cis people can't resist standing in judgement over which transes are the bad ones, that's all.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But this interpretation, the *idea* of a robot slowly bleeding to death, trying to hang on, seems to be incredibly appealing. That interpretation seems to fit so easily with the piece; the viscera-like caked fluid on the arm, the evocative splatter, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# These folks seem to engage in a very particular pseudo-feminist woo more than anything. I'm not an expert, but looking through their social media stuff it definitely shows slipshod bio-essentialism and a kind of gross chauvinism of flattening other cultures to fit preconceptions. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# What about all of the Jewish folks who are marginalized in Israel for being the wrong ethnicity? What about oppressed non-settler Jews who live in Palestine? nnThat's disgusting, just naked anti-Semitism with the tiniest fig leaf of deniability.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The DGG community uses the same rhetoric, word for word pretty often, as early alt-right/gamergate; they do the same harassment and brigading but with plausible deniability, they have a lot of the same bugbears about the "unfairness" of being white, cis, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# This is just classism. Read about the Coal Wars, learn about the Ozarks, there's rednecks out there *today* risking life and limb to fight pipelines alongside indigenous water protectors. There's radical subcultures  in redneck areas that have roots back before the US existed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# No, it's very normal to expect people to respect your "pronouns and proclivities". Like, I imagine you're probably not referring to your cis uncle with pronouns other than he/him. If your straight cousin shows up with her bf, folks probably won't bat an eye. Just regular stuff.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# "Calling people soy? That's problematic sweaty. Why don't you listen to my favorite Stalinist tell you how to do better."]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You know trying to paint that as some sort of nazi sympathy is absurd, and pretty gross on your part. Just stop, don't do this terminally online song and dance.

I'm not gonna respond further, this is just kind of desperate and sad at this point.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# He had to watch two videos because the first one transed him, so he needed the second one to turn back]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Sure, walk me through your explanation for how that's misgendering.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Dude that's awesome! I'm so happy for you! 💙❤️🤍]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It has taken every ounce of my self control not to respond to this with my hot Santa take, and I think you did that on purpose 😜]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Vaush has the advantage that he usually gets to decide which haters are going to be highlighted, and how to frame their dislike.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# She didn't say either. nnShe did make an extremely enbyphobic comment downplaying the oppression of nonbinary folks and suggesting that they have it easier than binary trans people. She's since apologized and explained why she's was wrong to say those things.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Absolutely, Zionists are by definition ethno-nationalists. I just think it's good to be careful about potential friendly fire is all. Like I said, a lot of Jewish folks are also targeted by Zionists. Kind of like how white nationalist will label some whites degenerate, basically.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is honestly like seeing someone running a Food Not Bombs chapter and getting obsessed with whether or not they have a servsafe. It's a silly distraction with no real basis in the issue, and it's the kind of suggestive moral panic-y questions that show a lack of knowledge. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Like...no? Kinks aren't inherently different from other pleasurable behaviors we associate with sex. Like, if someone likes feet that's not different from liking abs or whatever. If some gym bro decides to go jogging shirtless and I enjoy that, neither he nor I are looking to cum]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Well, no, that can't be the issue. It's true that Black people in the US commit crime at a disproportionate rate, it's true that Jewish folks were disproportionately working in finance in the Weimar Republic. Those are facts; what you do with those facts is what matters.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That could be, she's been the target of the moment for a couple days now. That would kind of go to show the point of the tweet anyways though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Nope, because that's not what we're talking about and obviously no one believes that, which is why you said it. This is about harassment.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Sure, but like, so has the US. So has Brazil. So has Sweden. The kind of capitalist success you're talking about isn't liberation. 

Like yes, it's better to be well fed under a king than starving under a king, but that's not really a defense of monarchy.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# What happens if she gets a chance to help codify what queer identities are protected under the law, or which identities get gender affirming healthcare? 

What will her advocacy be like for kids who have suffered abuse like so many queer kids do?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Can I ask why? As far as I understood the joke was just that a dictator hates being referred to that way, and so doing it is funny]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Ok, that's a good point, yeah]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'd like to tell you a story about an art piece.

The piece is called Can't Help Myself, by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. 🧵 #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Hearing a version of that was integral to my egg cracking, it's honestly a powerful statement]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# And do those workplace rules have good results? Or do they just encourage secrecy, resentment, rumors, etc? 

If you're taking an "abstinence only" approach to dealing with relationships in the org, you're setting up for failure. You want openness, accountability, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# That's fair. I think when kneejerk rejection of radicalism is a major feature of the aesthetic of your politics, like it is with centrism, then everything else starts to look the same because of the lens you're looking through.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Just a whole bunch of folks that read both pages of On Authority and think that means they're the Theory Understanders, jumping to tell indigenous folks that the past couple centuries of indigenous struggle are actually just capitalist ethno-nationalism or something.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# You can't say that you want to deprive literal children of healthcare and pretend that's respect.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'm sorry, but according to the chivalric debate code you must take an extreme position on this very real issue now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Huh, so since trans woman are born without cervix, ovaries, etc, then trans women would also meet your definition. 

Well, that's a really strange idea of womanhood, but I can at least appreciate your support for trans people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I'm sure you meant well, but talking like that plays on a lot of legit anti-Semitic tropes. Zionists honestly don't care a lot of Jewish folks either; generally speaking non-white Jews are not treated well in Israel, and Zionists are quick to abuse any anti-Zionist Jew viciously.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Oh yeah, she's literally just lying through omission here. She wasn't doxxed in any meaningful way. There's literally article after article online about her expensive mansion, complete with pictures and descriptions of where it is, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Sometimes we just need to really think about who we might hurt. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yeah, that's definitely one dynamic that does so. Which is why things like accountability processes are so important. 

But let's not whataboutism this; the kind of hierarchal power structures you think are necessary for organizing enable abuse.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# To be honest, I think one of the reasons I find value in post-civ is that there seems to be a struggle to consider it without reaching for handy assumption. For example you very quickly jumped to totally individualized medicine production, a very obviously wrong thing ~]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# There are no hard boundaries, and I think it's pretty common to feel different versions of this, honestly.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# TERs and rape apologia, name a more classic combination]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Yeah, no, I agree; the criticism here should be directed at the enbyphobic comments. My first comment in this long thread specifically said her comments were enbyphobic. I was trying to address why I think the accusations of anti-Semitism miss the mark and decenter nonbinary folk]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# A person can't claim they're being respectful when they consistently traffic in and defend queermisia. These people want to be allowed to be as horrible as possible without consequences, that's it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'm sorry 😞  Twitter beef is often stupid but it can still be hurtful]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Ok, that's thoughtfully said, thank you! nnI worry sometimes that people get punished for being attracted to trans folks and talking about it, not in a chaser way but in a sex positive way, and that seems really unhelpful to me. But I see your point, for sure.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# But there's also a lot of reactionaries and a history of full blown white supremacists being officers and doing stuff like literally smuggling rocket launchers to white supremacist terrorist orgs. So like, real big problems too, even beyond the "these are imperial stormtroopers"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Queer solidarity, plus you're really thoughtful and genuine in your beliefs. Well, and like, those beliefs are consistently grounded in kindness and human flourishing, that matters a lot too; I wouldn't follow someone who was thoughtfully and genuinely Ben Shapiro lol]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# That's frequently not true in the case of colonial governments, where a racial minority is synonymous with state apparatus.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This! This is the baseline, this is the most basic decent thing, this is the point from which we can have productive conversations. It *has* to start with respecting each person's autonomy and identity. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# There's sure some parallels to the right wing moral panic about cancel culture here. Real similar rhetoric to the hand wringing about nazis losing their jobs.

Bigots being uncomfortable is good actually.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Honestly, I see Vaush as a good example of how mass online harassment tends to work? Like, he's been subjected to the same kinds of stuff as countless women, trans folks, and people of color; fortunately for him for a variety of reasons he largely hasn't been isolated ~]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# For real! I only learned of him around when he was starting to go downhill as far as I can tell, but it sure seems like a race to the bottom. He's already on that, "I'm an advocate for the transes, but these bad ones are going too far even for me!" grifting nonsense]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I guess I'm just not sure this is really a good model of accountability. I'm not sure what the goal is either.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Hey, for anyone that stumbles across this; this doofus is wrong. 

Your identity, your beliefs, they have value. If someone demands you shrink yourself into a box they find safe to handle, that person does not respect you or love you. Standing for your beliefs is good.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Oh yeah, some NSC or Proud Boy goon decides they're going to hatecrime you, or your land lord decides to throw you out, the second you tell them you use neopronouns they'll back off for sure.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# If I had said that you might have a point, I guess. Honestly it seems like you're the one doing Dresden apologia, making excuses for the depredations of powerful states because you can't imagine being both opposed to genocide and being opposed to the states that enact genocide.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Just a reminder that Maupin is a literal Nazbol, like he's talked about how he shares the Nazbol position when he was speaking at a Nazbol conference next to Aleksandr Dugin the Nazbol guy. The guy isn't even subtle. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# So you're not entirely wrong, but this kind of stinks too? Being trans online does frequently suck, and it's easy to feel the need to defend oneself. What sucks here is Sophie is trafficking in, like, horrifyingly cruel nonsense and trying to say it was, "just a joke".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# There's really no depth they won't sink to, wow]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Also, wait, I'm not saying that her transness should absolve her or anything, I'm saying that when we're trying to guess about someone's behavior, like accusing them of deflecting, that could be a factor. obviously a trans woman can do just as much harm as anyone else though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# It's something you see in all sorts of lefty spaces, like cooperative housing, affinity groups, etc; while the left is more attentive to this stuff, there's no immunity. Abusers in left spaces will be good at navigating those spaces, and using those social conventions to abuse.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The "victim complex card" narrative does a lot more disservice to trans folks than a trans person talking about how being trans online sucks sometimes. I think it could have and maybe should have been addressed differently is mostly it, I'm not saying you're awful or anything.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I've seen some stuff like this from fash in general, and from eco-fash specifically. There's a machismo reading you can have for stuff like "kill the human in your head", where it's about like getting rid of empathy, becoming "animalistic" in a really shallow adoring violence way]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Please think about stopping for a moment. You're trying to quibble about child sex slavery to defend a e-celeb. Again, I know literally nothing about you, but I think it's unlikely you'd do this if you took some time and got a little distance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'm just an internet weirdo, but I really like talking with you. Definitely not to minimize your problems or try to toxic positivity all over aspects of your sociality you dislike, but you're really thoughtful and genuine too and to me that makes it nice to talk to you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Ok. Now how does that lead to the conclusion that the three arrows symbol was popularized among US antifascists by nazi infiltrators?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Sure, and a xenogender person is their gender in the same sense that I'm a woman or a cis woman is a woman. A wolf gendered person would be literally wolf gendered.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# And it's not respect. Like what would "respecting that they believe it" mean exactly? Because when this person says that trans people without dysphoria aren't trans, that's inherently disrespectful.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Like, a *lot* of queer theory and feminism involves questioning both identity and identities. It's pretty clear that's generally cool. No one has to "get it", and in fact, I'm less concerned with if a person ever gets it than if they respect the right of others to be themselves.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# If they were any more oblivious they'd drown watching rain fall]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# It's the same problem; the problem is people not respecting the autonomy and identity of others. All of us trans folks have that struggle in common, that's the thing that underlies all the rest. nnWhat you're doing is the same as when some TER calls me a man in a dress.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I would *love* more mando lore stuff like that]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# College campuses are a pretty sure bet I've been told. Like, she's a moral panic weirdo who wants to do a War on Drugs but make it Red, but I think LSD is pretty easy to get depending on where you are.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Oh wow, amazing recommendation, thank you! 

(Also good way to stick it to all these parents-from-Footloose mfers lol)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Honestly, like, I know cis women; it takes them longer than 10 minutes too. This is just a wild thing to say lol]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[For real! You'll get more out of putting that effort into building solidarity and community with marginalized people than trying to deconvert fash, nine times in ten. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I think these are really good clarifications, thank you for putting in the effort. Nonbinary folks get treated really badly and specifically erased all too often, and even unintentionally reinforcing that stinks. nnI appreciate you, solidarity 💙❤️🤍❤️💙]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's cool to dislike Vaush, and in fact it's cool to think that he's engaged in awful racism. But every time there's a big hate fest for Vaush, a bunch of "leftists" display that they low key think queer men are predatory. Just real gay panic nonsense.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Like, no, you cannot make an appeal to some vague general principle here. It is good to prevent bigots from having authority. It is good to make it difficult to be a bigot in public. If someone wants to argue this stuff is inappropriate, they need to defend the *specifics*.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# True, but also contextual? 

Like, I'm a binary trans woman, and some medical aspects of my transition make it harder for people to erase my identity, but also that can make me a target for hatecrimes in ways that are harder for me to hide. Privilege isn't simple calculations.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Like for instance groypers are centrist because they hate women and Jewish folks, but they believe that gay sex can be justified, so it's a mixed bag. nnNo lol, literally everyone has some views that are considered left and right, preponderance and behavior matters.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# No one who thinks that is going to be convinced by argument. A person who believes that a child's rib and tooth found in the place people are pretty sure dead children were put isn't evidence of a dead child is invested in that narrative in a way that argumentation won't fix.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One of the complicated parts of all this is that "choice" can mean different things, refer to different aspects of one's identity and expression, etc.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I used to be an anti-theist, and slowly left that behind as I developed an understanding of hierarchies and authority and became an anarchist. In a way my anti-theism was heavily based on just not having a very good understanding of authoritarianism and believing it came from ~]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# No, I think it's important to always make room for questions and exploration. The problem is when respect for a person's autonomy is withheld because of a lack of understanding.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They've talked before about struggling with harmful behaviors online, especially when it comes to twitter, including struggling to not use twitter. I don't think they're going to stop.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Mmm. A self described tankie defending the herrenvolk socialists. 

Shocking.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That's actually brain destroyingly self contradictory, absolutely wild]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# How's it our best shot? Like, what's the strategy and how does it work?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# No. This isn't the Twitch Academy of Philosophy, we're not getting into the semiotics of "bigot". People commonly understand that Klansmen are bigots, but hating Klansmen categorically isn't bigotry; I am virtually certain you understand this, and I'm not interested in the game.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Also, it's really really weird to specifically call out Maoists when you're trying to crib the mass line concept. Like, I'm not a huge Maoism fan, but give them credit when you're borrowing their ideas, this is just rude]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# He could address the substance of things without mentioning a person, or he could reply to them directly, I say once again as we circle around all the stuff you're desperately ignoring on purpose.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yeah. Lefty unity is a mistaken idea in every regard. 

It also always gets presented as if it were bridging the gap between the two sides of the "left", but the idea of a ML/Anarchist dichotomy is mythology. There's a lot more tendencies, and MLs aren't a broad umbrella.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Big "youth pastor trying to sound edgy and cool" vibes]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Haz seems like he could really get into character as King Kong, there could be a whole thing here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Whoa, what? If something is a choice, that gives you a right to torture people? There's so many missing steps there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I think they sort of miss the mark here. The ways that capitalism disincentivizes cooperation creates incredible inefficiencies, but like, parallel development itself isn't strictly wasteful as long as the need it's meeting makes sense.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Yeah, Zionists hate Jewish leftists about as much as they hate anyone, and they work overtime to wedge younger Jewish folks off from the left. They're all to happy to side with far right anti-Semites if they can use that to smear leftists as the "real anti-Semites"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Tankies do a particular kind of entryism through the guise of "left unity", and inevitably some folks fall for it. So most likely what's going on is she sees SocDems as reformist weirdos and has disagreements with tankies but at least they're "fellow revolutionaries".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I think he's pretty cool and has made some really worthwhile contributions, I think a lot of the time it's just annoying that people who want to benefit from the radical aesthetic of calling themselves anarchist while not being that will quote a lot of Chomsky.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I guess as far as more "traditional" problems with online left-ish spaces; there's a lot of horrifying acceptance of things like Stalin apologia, genocide denial, and naked authoritarianism. There shouldn't be room for that stuff, and it shouldn't be treated as a twee aesthetic.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# 100%

I don't think this person is fash; they're close enough to use the lingo though]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# A thing I wish these people understood better is that like actual ethicists use some mix of utility, rules, and virtue; the kind of absurd purity the debate brains value isn't really useful or teneble, which is why people don't do it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think this video is super worth your time if you've been even tangentially aware of the Luna Oi/Emerican Johnson/Vaush conflict. There's some good breakdown of some misunderstandings that seem common in some lefty spaces. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# No worries. There's kind of no good reason presented to believe that xenoestrogens present the kind of threat to "bio-masculinity" the blackpaper suggests anyways, so either the author didn't offer what evidence they had or they didn't know themselves.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# How do we even approach accountability when the police are largely accountable to themselves? Like, they're a government institution that's mostly responsible for investigating themselves, and who answers to the state. Tt seems like a recipe for disaster and overreach.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It's totally untenable. I mean, there's a long history of gay folks marrying someone of the opposite gender as part of hiding their sexuality; did that un-gay them? I kind of don't think the author would say so. It's just to attack bi people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# For sure. Peoples on the ground work *should* be taken into account when trying to figure out their character, but but it isn't everything. Especially when it's something as harmful as this, that's not the sort of thing that should be allowed and it does reflect on her for sure.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# So like, "filthy" is *your* term of art here, but also do you think the fact that you're (sort of) quoting someone else makes it better?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# No, I'm not sure how that would follow; rather, Chomsky's definition is open ended enough that conservatives can also use it. That doesn't make it bad or wrong, it's just a feature of using that particular definition.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Those are fair distinctions. My opinion here is definitely also shaped by my own experiences with anprims, which probably skews things honestly. I think there's stuff where I would still have like irreconcilable disagreements on important things with anprims though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The Nazis were like this, Mussolini's Fascists were like this, all of them. Fascism has always been a tantrum of those with structural power. What makes it dangerous isn't steely-eyed cinematic sociopathy; it's the absurd cruelty these smug, fearful weirdos will do to feel better #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I agree with you, but the dirtbags paved the way for people to consider Dore to be on the left; they helped build the trojan horse he benefitted from. Without Chapo putting out drivel about how the secret to communism is being meaner to minorities, we might not be where we are.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# There's also the fact that there are content creators who are associated more with that side of things and who aren't cis white men, like Demon Mama and Shark3ozero. 

(Also, wild to call other folks socdems while defending tankies)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The biggest difference in my mind is that those kind of debate club events made it clear that the thing on display was the skill at performative debate, rhetoric and gamesmanship etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Ok, well then I've addressed those points already. There's really nothing more I can say at that point?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# She doesn't believe this, but she believes things adjacent enough to arrive here and pretend. Like, while this is the most over the top version, she traffics in the underlying reactionary sentiments all the time.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Huh, weird for them to get included with the rest. I feel like other than the Dengist, this would be chill. Uh, probably don't mention nonbinary folks around Contra, but y'know, other than that...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Yeah, that content creator clique seems to be like that. Like ThoughtSlime, Sophie, Tristan from Step Back History, etc, are all kind of like that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Cherry's streams are always a good time, come hang out! #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I think this is to some extent a problem of terminology. Destiny is on the left in terms of the current overton window in the US, but isn't on the Left in a broader sense. He's also been getting steadily more reactionary alongside his fanbase.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Only on twitter could helping vulnerable people access necessary healthcare be seen as suspect. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# But, calling the Holocaust a Jewish aesthetic is also reductive to the point of just being false. The fact that the Holocaust was explicitly anti-Semitic and that the same anti-Semitism exists today as a threat to contemporary Jewish folks isn't a brand or whatever.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yes. It was a whole video she did. It ranks up there as far as queerphobic stuff I've heard. She just repeatedly insists that queer movements in red states are puppets of imperialism, and insists that Lương Thế Huy being drummed out of politics had nothing to do with homophobia.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Have a very lovely relevant time of day, and try not to randomly smear people who, I don't know, clothe the unhoused or something.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Or like, the "coming to power" bit kind of heavily implies ML state communists, but I don't want to assume]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yeah, for sure. I remember watching Inglourious Basterds and thinking to myself, "Wow, lot of swatikas, this movie must be sympathetic to nazis."

This is so silly, come on]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I wonder if there's some reason you thought of gay sex and polycules while you were pearl clutching.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# No? No, you don't actually have to accept additional risks because you accepted one risk as necessary. If I go skydiving you don't have a right to sneeze into my mouth.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I've resisted getting a blahaj so far, don't tempt me]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Really good point, yeah. Like, if that's what you organize for that's what will happen, and the authoritarianism can flourish more easily than the rest of the ideology.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I don't know if they're especially bad; his ideas are unremarkable, he was kind of a stodgy, uninspired thinker who was better at rhetoric than the rest, and his disdain for the lower classes showed through now and again. Mostly his work is forgettable, and should be forgotten.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I hope I haven't been mean or given you the impression that I have some sort of personal problem with you, I don't. To me this conversation has mostly seemed strange; from my perspective you sounded like someone with an axe to grind, and I was a bit curious about that was all.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Are the PL actually not at all liberal? Like, you can't just say you're not a liberal if you collaborate with fascists, and also very far right liberals like Thatcher and Reagan aren't not liberals just because they were right wing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Antifascism as a single value disconnected from the rest of one's politics is kind of precarious, I think. Like, dedicated antifascists are usually also involved in community building work, anti-capitalism, etc, because fascism needs a foundation of misery to rise from.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I didn't go through everything and I'm not going to at this point; nothing there seems to be any sort of evidence of legitimacy, everything looks divorced from context. I can't say for sure it's a hit job, but it looks exactly like a hit job would look.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Both of those facts are the result of systemic oppression. Jewish folks have historically been oppressed in Europe through being *forced* to do finance for instance. But they don't become un-fact-ed because of that. If you're going to tackle these issues that's good to understand]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Ooo, that's a good idea. What's the full construction?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Like, people of every gender have a variety of relationships to gender, and I don't want to oversimplify. But you're just flat out wrong, to the extent that it seems like you've never engaged with any xenogender people, nevermind queer theory or anything.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Mmm, sounds controversial. I, as a neutral and reasonable™️ person think that we can say that Crowder is very naughty, but it would be an unforgivable crime to even suggest he shouldn't have influence through his platform.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Ooo, fancy, that's like eight kinds of transphobia folded in on each other]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Hey, maybe delete this and go and learn some things about Jewish struggles, maybe talk to some Jewish folks? nnWe can criticize people who want to police who's allowed to be afraid of Nazis without eliding the specific, targeted, and enduring violence Jewish people face.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The short answer is that biology isn't a super useful way to categorize people in this regard. Obviously correlations exist, but honestly there's still so much biological variation within sexed categories that it's just not super helpful.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# No, you don't need to apologize, that's really fascinating, thank you so much!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Optics is a red herring, honestly. Messaging, agitprop, and just being consistent will do more than any concerns about optics ever can. Worrying about optics only really makes sense for tactics where the optics are part of the point.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Some folks just just honestly believe that oppression is bad. It doesn't have to be a conspiracy theory.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I wonder what actions a person could justify if they believed they were being targeted like Jewish folks were during the Holocaust.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I think we're expressly talking past each other. I don't know that I'm equipped to communicate effectively here. Everything about this has been frustrating, it feels to me like nonbinary folks got thrown under the bus first by Cay and then by harassers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I don't think people misinterpreted it, I think you miswrote. Like, you might not have intended to say that drugs and sex aren't valid ways to have fun, but that is what you said. 

And like, that happens it's fine, but don't try to blame everyone else?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The enbyphobic things you said are harmful, I hope you'll honestly talk to folks with different experiences; struggles that are different from ours aren't lesser.

But holy crap, the level of vicious misogyny that's come out is absolutely vile, this is awful]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It's not "bad framing", whatever that means to you. 

You think youth liberation in general is kind of a bad idea, and you decided to be rude about it. Now you're mad that you're being criticized for petty cruelty. This vague gesture towards optics or whatever is an excuse.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Oh yeah, for sure, they got the stake in there real good]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yes, manipulating people is bad. Not all propaganda is manipulative. As an example, something like an awareness campaign for the dangers of sharing needles is propaganda; it's meant to get a certain kind of action from the audience and further an agenda(i.e. stop needle sharing)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yes, but there is also implied a lot of responsibility there. You should be cautious and thoughtful if you're going to purposefully participate in making someone miserable(and potentially worse). There should be a pretty high degree of certainty you've got it right.]]></document>
