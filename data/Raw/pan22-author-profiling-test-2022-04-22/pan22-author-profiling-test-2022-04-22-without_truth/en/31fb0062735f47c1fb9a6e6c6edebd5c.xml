We’ve not made any progress to date. By voting Tories we are allowing for this to continue. People are very smart. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# is unconstructive, as now allowing people to respond.

In addition our lovely and very credible PM (#HASHTAG#) signed the Brexit contract. 
Are we now saying our PM may not be that smart at all? 😂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# So, we’re unable to honour Johnson’s oven ready deal, so play the game by trying to push the blame onto EU?
Very ethical &amp; mature. We’ll get far.

The name indicates what free ports are all about, due to lack of regulation it's an ideal hub for money laundering and tax evasion.
You clearly have a good business acumen.
