		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I hadn't actually, you know, thought of that.  Is this my face palm moment?  That's funny!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# You make me laugh. Seems only fair to return the favor. Don't have your finesse, but I do try.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# You are indulging in hyperbole and are quickly becoming irrelevant as a leader.  Rethink your bombast.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Thanks for this, for reminding us how often their voices addressed our hopes, dreams, and fears. In 1965 I was working in the Tioga area of Philly where this was THE music, and I learned to stroll, to bugaloo and to get into the music and the message. Makes me smile. Thank you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# That was always my situation. In a busy world, a box of crackers on an impulse is very nice to have. They aren't cheap, but they are SO worth it.  You can mail order them for less than retail.  Have the plain ones in bulk boxes at Costco if you shop there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I see millions, especially younger people, newly engaged in the fight. The polls are important-70% don't want Trump again - and the special elections, local elections are going heavily Dem. We lose if and only if we quit fighting for our democracy.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Of course not. Some have argued we'd get 2 Senators with 2 votes: President and First Lady. But none of them has lately voted FROM the White House but from their home state. DC proper doesn't need statehood but the surrounding area does: 51st state.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Nonsense. He did the right thing, saved more lives than ever before in history. he was handed a major pile of steaming dung, and got beyond it to save 120,000 people's lives. That's not POSSIBLE to ignore.  Don't be cranky just to be cranky.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# What a ridiculous article. Same thing said about Obama. Never enough after ONE year. Well, if 400 years of oppression and discrimination can't be fixed in a single year, I guess it will never be. Let's just give up then. The RW is counting on it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# All the actual Karens I know are marvelous women, the embodiment of the ANTI-Karen.  Unfortunate name choice, but there it is.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# But Garland isn't doing anything. Well, when these guys roll to save themselves, we will get even more. Climb the pyramid of decision making - you get the big guy at the top.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It is a global movement that started decades ago with the loss of Empire in Europe, the free speech from fascists there. We need to have a global discussion about how "free" speech can be, how to curtail actions such as these.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# True enough, but they make a great show of concern for active troops. That false reverence is most conspicuously absent in their disdain for veterans. You're correct that they don't care about ANY of us.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I was getting to know a wonderful woman AME pastor when a white male, over 50 w ear plugs, came up. Asked what we were discussing: Black women's leadership. Said, "Oh I know all there is to know about being a Black woman." To her credit, he lived...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# So you want to risk letting him off for insufficient evidence?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You aren't alone. That is the go to for homeless folks. But you're missing the point that truly indigent people do NOT eat at McD's. They scrounge and eat out of dumpsters. SNAP is a blessing for them. No one should live that way. And $3 won't cut it today on P'butterbread.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I know where WE are. I refuse to give ground letting where HE is prevail.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# No.  He had already sunk the economy and destroyed much of the society in other ways.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I have found most (by no means all) CA laws are pretty moral. They fall apart at implementation. MUCH is done in our county that is actually NOT what the law requires. I've seen this over and over. Implementation is the point that needs MUCH work.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Remember it is reported that Senior has told trusted allies to make sure if one of his kids has to go to prison, that it's Junior, not Ivanka.  One has no need to wonder why he's this messed up.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I think he means yes...kinda hard to tell...      🙄]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Well, see, I didn't think at first he knew. The one he had and kept was Rosemary and Sea Salt. It's quite strong, so I mention that. Upon reflection, I think that was what he was sent to get, but he looked so puzzled, I tried to "help". Not sure I did. Note to self: ASK first?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Or the 9 year old girl getting an 'automatic shooting experience' birthday treat. She'd had NO experience with any guns, panicked and lost control, killing the instructor.  She has to live with that forever. Adults do no favors letting kids have access.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Very true AND it is highly personal. I am utterly intolerant of a very common drug. Who knew? Should that influence the 99.99% who handle it fine? No. It affects me but not others. I do not define "safety".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# THIS time it is multiracial and the GOP have declared massive antagonism to WHITE poor people, too. Equal opportunity death.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# He calls all of us socialists and antifa supporters. So the LOGIC would be that we'd welcome them in, offer lemonade and cookies, and all go our way peacefully.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# And, as the First Amendment guarantees, people expressed theirs right back atcha. Suck it up. That's called a 'discussion'.  You said it. You own it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Inflation is a private sector zap of consumers. Unless people WANT a dictator, there isn't a lot a president can do about it. Biden is looking at anti-trust/anti-monopoly issues. That's about it. Don't like it? DON'T BUY HIGH PRICED STUFF.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Get well quickly and without any complications or discomfort.  Best wishes!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Quick thumbnail - are stores in your area experiencing shortages or not?  Please say where you are generally.  The "Biden is causing shortages" mantra is everywhere when many states and chains are doing fine.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You meanie. Telling truth in the face of their rants.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'd like to get rid of Christian Rock. Kid Rock will take care of it himself.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Nonsense. That demeans the entire issue by appropriating what the labor movement has significantly been able to change v chattel slavery.  Stop draping the mantle of slavery over your privileged shoulders.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# He got Proud Boys and Oath Keepers indicted on CONSPIRACY. They were in on the Jan. 5 planning. From there to the inner circle in the Willard, Trump Hotel, and from there to Trump.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I know - Twitter has become your prissy homeroom teacher.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Boomer is my friend who would NEVER take away anyone's rights other than those who commit crimes. Your nervousness about him seems...odd. You want to confess something, dear? Don't diss Jackson. He's a good person to even you. Unless you're a criminal.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Anything that pink isn't redacted. It means that is a phony. Someone is fooling with you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I think the march away from corporate jobs, the ways people are voting Dem in local and special elections, show that's not true. Yes, the forces of the Right are strong, but they are not entrenched unless we allow it. And people are NOT allowing it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# No because there is no core goal. They are fighting among themselves as the Minutemen and others did not. They are at odds with their former allies, and they are rolling on one another to save themselves.  It is the Civil War's death song, not a prelude to success.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That is always my reaction.  Ugh. Wouldn't one prefer to be god loving?  Icky world they've created.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I've not been, but I have several friends who did and loved it. Pre-tsunami, of course.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yes - that is a consideration. But I appreciated what they offered when we had it. I seriously miss it. So do homeless folks.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Good eyes! I think he was not documenting the famous photo but the Chrysler Building. The recording of high iron workers and other kinds of jobs was part of the WPA. That documentation survives today in the Historic American Engineering Record.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Exactly! In our Buffalo neighborhood, only one who didn't do it was my husband. He had a heart murmur, I didn't want to be a widow, and I liked it while he hated it. Who cares? Women can do most anything, and we do what we WANT. NOT helpless at all!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# See...this is where we need the second person plural. I hail from a region that does it well, "youse". Southern folks do it graciously, "y'all".  But it's VERY useful however it's done. And the wild rice is primo. English Breakfast I'd opine... I agree about cold coffee. 🤮]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Butbutbut the PUNDITS say Americans don't care about 1/6.  You mean we DO?  How very interesting. Yes. We do. And that will be part of the message 2022. Along with what we have seen the administration accomplish. Please tell the pundits to grow up? Thank you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My cat has been plotting since she was 3 months old how to jump from the mantle to the moving blades of the ceiling fan. I believe she has been studying the exact angle and velocity needed. It's only a matter of time until we have liftoff. I'll keep you posted.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I started repair work with a short 10 minute walk (unless it's minus 15 as it was!) which cleared my head. Gradually - VERY gradually - extended it. Even some light weight lifting on bitter cold days helps. Walking around the house for that time is fine, too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Oh he'll just whine. "They never pick meeeeee."  Smacking him down is more effective than the Eternal Whining of the Rightwing Mind.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Apparently the Instacart person, given a heads up by the family, sailed right in and ignored them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I have gotten every one of the residents of my back yard housing, jobs, services. And I don't stand in judgement of their personal habits other than illegal drugs. They are ADULTS many of whom have veterans' status, long work histories, talents. Your sniffy superiority is gross.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Why do we want Medicare for All?  It's not remotely the most effective plan as now conceived. Do you have data on the multiplier effect of an across the boards 40% cut in reimbursements? The four times higher cost to the working poor than ACA? It's not legislation but a fantasy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It's not. We have a vastly stronger democracy with far more engaged people opposing the march to fascism.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Lots of places are reporting weather and COVID as personnel issues, yes.  Also slow stock arrivals.  Thanks for your insights.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Well PCH, Rt. 1 has partly collapsed. So if you go, you HAVE to use 101!!!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# You get lots of that in the many national parks that tell the whole story. Individual statues lauding traitors really serve no purpose other than to fan the lies of the Confederacy as "legacy". It was treason. It needs not be celebrated but TOLD as at Gettysburg etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Every step is a step. Sometimes the body and brain need a breather.  I hope you can do something that gives you peace and/or pleasure. We honor you and thank you for sharing your journey with us.  We respect you so much!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# On Chucky's MTP, a GOP anti Trump person said Biden had so many 'failures' from Afghanistan (saved 120K people) to COVID (no, saved lives galore), to supply chain (no, it's doing well) to inflation (global-really?) Those are the issues. Let's push back the GOP narratives.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I'd have done the same. AND bought him a pack cuz I don't judge. I have had about 14 people living in my backyard (not all at once) with others casually stopping as needed. We do what we can. Gov't needs REAL solutions for them. Thank you for caring. Seriously. NOT just saying it]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Whether or not she was actively seditious in 1/6, these facts alone call Thomas' judicial independence into question.  If any other justice had such a conflict, all holy hell would break loose. This needs to be examined, his rulings looked at for conflict of interest.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Most of what Biden is doing extends what - gasp - noted far left zozializt Dwight Eisenhower started. Someone should tell Doocy that  - but he probably has no idea who Eisenhower was.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Since i do public policy analysis and have for years, I offer you actual information. You have given the vast majority of Americans zero reason to make this a priority. It comes off entirely as selfish privilege. So perhaps you could learn something.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I interact with homeless folks who got off the streets and got cars. They immediately gained a lot of weight. They were no longer walking several miles a day.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Hey - I shop there. I found it helping homeless folks set up apartments. Then I discovered I liked it! I've bought wine glasses and bowls among other durable things. I really like their stuff.  Mine just closed. We are ALL desolate!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'm not dead, not even down. I'm functioning as i always have and yes, we have 5G here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# We MUST tolerate him with such a narrow hold on the Senate.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Pretty clear that most Black Americans have roots in the colonies and country far deeper than those of most white folks. My family got here pretty early.  Not as long as most Black people. Those who came via Ellis Is. (opened 1892) can't hold a candle.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I can get it anywhere. I have a car. We have stores. It is not about me. It's about the homeless folks I serve who have access problems esp. since the dollar store closed here. All the others are in the burbs. MOST of them try to eat decently. You don't know them or us.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Guilt is appropriate even if it's not for ourselves. We did terrible things to your people. Why should we NOT feel shame and make amends?  I agree - it's the only way to assure it never happens again.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Working people means MOST of us, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity. We share more than we are different, and we let the rich drive us apart. Historically and contemporaneously true.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# They are the same mindset as those smearing feces on the US capitol walls. No. Not EVERYTHING is tolerated and OK. We are not people without standards. This is disgusting.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Our police in my neighborhood are pretty good. The racially diverse homeless folks in my backyard don't have problems w them overall. But other parts of the city - not as good. It got better when we all protested. Public voices do matter. Not yelling but very FIRM.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I remember the horrid ice storms of the late 90s in Quebec that cracked the steel on high tension standards. This just looked tired and ready for a nap. But it was far more complete a collapse than the ice storm ones!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'm wearing KN95 leaving the N95 for frontline health workers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Now, that's just mean.  Funny, but mean.  Thank you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You know those amazing photo images made out of tiny other photos? Anyone w that gift might make a US symbol from photos of people of color. Americans making up America. I haven't the talent. So I offer the idea to those who do.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# There aren't even slurs for white folks. Honkey? We did it first as Hunkey against Hungarians, other "bohunk" immigrants. Cracker is our term for white mule drivers. Redneck is our urban sneer at farmers. WE started the insults. We have ourselves to blame. Uncomfortable? Snort.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Being young and being trusted are almost mutually incompatible.  She did win, you know. That said, she doesn't wish to run, and I respect that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They'd see that no matter what.  I have made the mistake of replying to /msn.com stories and cannot believe the detachment from reality among his cult. I think the 'worried middle' LIKE to see Jen and Biden stand their ground. The cult would hate them if they cured cancer.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# For whatever reason we average 20 gallons/day per person (2).  Not using even drip irrigation but hand watering w buckets.  One minute showers. Not even a problem for us.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# This is where the seditious conspiracy is leading. OKs link to Stone. Stone was in the Willard. Willard links to TFG.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I could live with some who are anti abortion so long as they were respectful of other people's decisions AND worked tirelessly for excellent maternal and child care. I've known many Catholics like that. Where are the rest?  Being "mandatory birth" is NOT being "pro life".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# No.  No they don't.  They've been seduced by zippy movies and TV and think it's a slam dunk.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Puree some of the vegetables to thicken it. Add flour and water or corn starch and water blended in equal amounts. Keep the lid off for another hour if you just want the water to cook off.  Put in a stove top pan and turn it on medium high for a bit. Separate suggestions, BTW.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They'd BETTER.  In 1789 there were almost no corporations, towns regulated all business, prices. No right to private property. A contract was a bond on you no matter what the other guy did. Everything biz has today is because the Constitution is a living document.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# BAM!!! That's perfect!!!  Another thing - make everyone at all meetings sign in w their address and show ID to prove they have kids or reside there. We did that on the ACA town halls after nasty disruptions. It worked. Ended HUGE amounts of trouble. Then ask these questions!!!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I'm fine with his decision to include a Black woman on the bench.  I don't see the problem. Every white person, regardless of qualifications, gets a pass. Why is this controversial?  He's picking from the already qualified. So what?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Trump is the supplier in the supply chain of COVID.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Of course not.  Ms. Diana is going to be the one holding the bag - the O2 bag - if she thinks this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I've been impressed with him. As a Chicago oriented kid, that rarely happens w an Illinois governor. He's been really solid as far as I can see from CA.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Started about 5 seconds after Obama was inaugurated, they CLAIM they and only they know the Constitution and will DISOBEY unlawful (sic) laws. They interpret the Constitution their own way, of course.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# This is just heartbreaking. PTSD and moral injury happen daily to our frontline workers. PLEASE start assembling rotating on-site mental health and spiritual health teams for them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# And yet, when she presents to the ER gasping for air, she will take ANYTHING they give her and take up space from others who made a wise choice but have other problems.  Can ANYONE make this make sense?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# A couple of weeks ago one of us posted that she was in a grocery, fully stocked, listening to a MAGA on her cell phone saying the shelves were empty.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Mr. Lewis nailed it in ONE word, yes.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My mother died. I never shed a tear in 20 years. My father was another matter. But not for her. I'm not angry. I'm not obsessed w her. I feel nothing and care nothing. I know what she did OK. I know what she did terribly.  I live my best life, no mourning her and her awfulness.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# So would you be happy w the organizers on Jan 5 being indicted? Well, they have been - Proud boys and Oath keepers who were in the Jan. 5 planning. Next Stone et al. Then Trump.  Happy yet?  Being happy of course doesn't interest us - seeing justice on the move DOES.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Gosh, ya think? Picked by JDs who are funded by TYT who are funded by GOP/Libertarian $$.  I mean there can't be a link there or anything, right?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# OMG - the 70s are back for old men pretending to be young again.  All he lacks are the gold chains.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The only comments that do seem to work is whether that decision is working for them. Assure them if it's not, you're there to help; then, if it's not dangerous or illegal, try to let it happen. Learning from experience is good.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Gladys White and the Dips, version II.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# She is, of course, unique. It's not her status as daughter but as "advisor" that brings her the attention. Find another child in that position under a Dem administration, they'd be called. You just won't. Nepotism and favoritism are a GOP thing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# She made little pretense of piety until now. Too late to court the very people who will reject her anyway.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Ben Carson has nothing to offer anyone on any topic.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Taking care of yourself is wise. You are in our hearts. Do what is best for you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Because ONE party finds the chaos useful.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# It's buried in a drawer, but it was something to see. My grandmother is in a long dress and coat, high button boots, and a very jaunty hat. She was a tiny woman. Will of iron.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# This shifts what was a promising argument about media to another "Dem message" problem.  It isn't. It IS a media problem.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I thought you gave up when Trump beat your pants off the last four years.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Same here. My Dad was a disabled WW II vet. My mother and I never used the handicapped space if he wasn't in the van. People thought that we were silly not to, but we didn't have disabilities. Why WOULD we?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I think they will meet at the top. House is picking up the electeds and their minions, DOJ is working the actual thugs. Both should remove all the "alternative theories of the case" defense possibilities so guilt is stunningly clear.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# So was she marching with the anti abortion zealots or the white supremacists who took over the whole thing? Inquiring minds want to know: which side are you on, Marge? Which side are you on?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I doubt, if you think it was MTG or LB, that it is correct. We shall see.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yes. Only they deserve to be discredited. She already DID most of what they propose, and they live on fantasy and stolen valor while she continues to achieve progressive goals.  I'm thrilled she has that much room in your head!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Normally kids are off limits, even middle aged ones. But they plunked their tushes into the White House, were privy to high level confabs, and, well, that makes them fair game.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# We NEED to be both patient AND focused. We have to win elections. Last night there were HUGE Dem victories in special elections. GA won 40 races locally. We have to keep that work going while the House/DOJ and states do theirs.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Brown v Board of Ed, Little Rock, and other steps to equality unleashed the fresh hell of violence against the Civil Rights movement. We quashed a lot of that. We will do it again. This time w far more emphasis on the ideology not just the law.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# On second view, the lack of concern for the guy in the grave makes me wonder if it REALLY WAS an accident.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# He thinks working class is ONLY old white guys from the Rust Belt. Well, unions are steadfast, and yeah, some WCWGs (™️) are departing, but the Working Class is EVERYONE.  He has never faced that fact.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# You are correct. This is not the same issue at all. This is a volunteer fire/rescue. No one is paid ever. This is about community, solidarity, succession of caring people. If you can't see that, it's slovenly materialist reductionism. "Sacrifice of childhood" is also privileged.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Don't forget Girls. A la Matt and a whole flock of others.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Ms. Arquette - listen to Meg who listens to Hillary. We are not broken and refuse to be.l]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Those are the markers of a borderline personality disorder.  Ignore them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yes. There is a story - he's a stuntman. Pretty amazing though!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# He has gotten many things very wrong. The sparkle is off the Silver.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# That's very much MY point. The prohibitive laws are going to hurt rural folks, older white people, those who travel for their jobs, those w long shifts, MANY of them GOP.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Interesting. My hubs has a CPAP - do you think it acts as a brain vacuum or the equivalent of a sump pump to move that fluid?  I feel there are untapped smart ass remarks I could use with this information.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# NHS is cutting services, denying access to expensive procedures and innovative meds. The pro nat'l health service folks in the US are silent on it as Bern was silent on the VA, HIS gold standard. Admit gov't isn't BETTER?  Can't have THAT.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Not all fed prisons are cushy. Danbury CT is one of the women's prisons, and it's pretty tough. I helped send someone there. She did NOT enjoy it. There are a few that are cushy. Most are pretty grim.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# You're adding to the problem. When cops come, they can't tell you from the other source. Police already shot and killed the "good guy" thinking he was the "bad guy"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Maybe, but this sounds real. He spoke of its being in his lungs this time.  That is too sophisticated for his tiny mind to make up. It also sounds serious.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# One child development person suggested you just say, "Well, I'll love you no matter where you are."  It's actually kind of scary for teens to think of it as an actual choice.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# You missed the Blue Tsunami 2018? You missed she isn't POLITCAL leader but POLICY leader and that she has passed enormous amounts of outstanding legislation? Learn what she does before you berate because she's the best we ever had. We are NOT getting smashed. Pay attention.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Of course! And Reconstruction, Jim Crow, Civil Rights and should encompass the stories of all people who live here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Same here!  Homeless folks I know were the same. This is a remarkable feat for a highly diverse economic base. EVERYONE could get vaccinated for free.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I would talk it that this isn't ready to go. And no, that was not a core campaign promise. Much has been alleged about it that isn't true. And most of us in policy advocacy don't want that alone. We want broader interest reform. So you're barking up the wrong tree w me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# They blocked the change to the filibuster, not the legislation. There is no issue of filibuster here. I don't think they'll block the nominee. Maybe.  I just don't think so.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# If you google his name, you'll find some.  Maybe as good as what you had?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Is there ANY movement or human experience they won't exploit? Holocaust, slavery, women's rights, now freeeeeedom a la Rev.Dr. King?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I have bought cold storage containers for homeless folks, but in 100 degree weather, they last only so long. I KNOW people have gotten sick from spoiled food. Not deathly ill but upchucking ill, and then the nourishment is gone. What is wrong with us?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# We wish you all the best.  I have a friend who has gone through bowel and breast cancer and is now living her best life.  There IS hope on "the other side".  I'm so glad you have support going through it though.  Best wishes!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# No - Twitter just didn't show this until now.  Happy Birthday!  Hope you had a good day other than here!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# She is in a fight for voting rights?  Wouldn't verify that by my observations.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I could see the utilities, but the rent is for space not the person.  If they will let you rent out the room to someone else for that month, use the space as they wish, then OK (joking) but otherwise the rent is the rent.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# This is ALEC leaders presenting the Eastman doctrine to CNP. Happened Feb. 2020, video release is October. They were ALL in on it. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# He hasn't failed at all. So the parsing of accusations needs to be reviewed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Subtext - Trump endorses me, I die as a candidate.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Believe it or not, I had a neighbor in the 90s who did think what McVeigh did was wonderful.  That sort of thinking underpins the insurrection and Babbit worship.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I am more than familiar with these issues. It is what nuke promoters wish us not to know. I did a study of nuke accidents about the production, waste, and power facilities, and it was appalling. Idaho Falls '62 on.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Not at all.  The Right has accused them of sheltering migrants and "sex traffickers" because they filed an injunction against the Wall that would cut through their property.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It's getting harder by the second to care about such people. Que sera, sera...whatever thing dumb you did.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I think they don't. We fought a war and lost hundreds of thousands to end that vile view. No, they do NOT have the 'right to speak' ACLU's insistence otherwise. We have certain limits on speech, and true threats remain a bar. They issue true threats. Nope.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Remember State ordered people to evacuate starting in March. By the final time, many who were dual citizens elected to stay.  If you're faulting 400 not extracted, where is the respect for the 120,000 saved? Since then many of the 400 have gotten out. You want war instead?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Roe is based on Common Law that distinguished being "merely pregnant" and "quick with child". The third trimester requires, always has, a compelling argument on the mother's safety and life. No arguments for unfettered abortion in the third tri have EVER won.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My point is the STATE in which voting can occur (Veep and 2nd Gentleman included) would have the two new senators and 1-2 Reps. The District would have no voters (though homeless folks on the Mall still disenfranchised), be much smaller, and that would be fine.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# And triple tens of millions are in line w the Constitution, law, and even our military to tell them HELL NO!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The key issue is that it is the work of the PRIVATE sector and is global. This is grounded in "if I CAN get top dollar, I will, and hang the consequences."]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Every example you give is miraculous, supra human. And no, the vaccine is NOT made from embryonic tissue. It was used in developing it, not manufacturing it. And Jesus did say go forth and heal the sick. He did not limit HOW.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Damn. That's not how I celebrate "Twelfth Night" - I just have a dozen irritating drummers drumming tonight. That's bad enough. Who needs rockets?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# He is a great human being, but i don't think he was a great president. His cozy relationship w the Shah said he was not that discerning, and it was chaos. But who he is now? Unparalleled.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I was in on a small discussion with her after. That was our reaction. POC are just trick ponies for show. She has a new book out, "White Evangelical Racism" (that is now on my "guilt pile" of unread books but that I REALLY want to read.) I respect her enormously, esp. for this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The net is tightening. Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, ones in planning Jan. 5, have been indicted on CONSPIRACY. Next the other conspirators at the Willard, Trump Hotel and beyond. Then...the Big Guy at the center. This is moving FAST. We DO see it if we pay attention.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well, there is no taint if they don't leak it which they are not. They're not the dumb ass RW attorney who sued me, some friends. Committee knows how to handle evidence w DOJ. It's the Other Side that doesn't follow chain of custody, etc. Rudy has it? REALLY? House is fine.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# We all get that, but their tactic was to delay long enough to mobilize states to overturn their own electors. Didn't work - Nancy Pelosi reconvened that night to hold the certification and killed their plan. This was the Emerson/ALEC plan. It failed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Find Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's Tweet today on how to make this work without abolishing the filibuster at all. It's what we did in 1965. We can do it again.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Every single right straight people have everyone should have.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# What I find odd is that the bill helps lots of people. Elders, the infirm, those who travel for work (truck drivers, RR crews, business people), people on long shifts, rural folks at some distance from towns, those w little kids at home. MANY GOP can't vote now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# The idea that sedition is "another political view" of equal merit means we are inches away from defending Dahmer and calling cannibalism "another equal lifestyle".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Hard to tell sometimes.  Think nothing of it. We've all made that mistake.  You can UNDO it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Then encourage us white people to keep it up for the next 11 months, then years, then life.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Writing it down is a form of "taking out the trash" - or garbage, whichever it may be. It helps. It helps to write the GOOD stuff, too. But write what you NEED to write. It really is a purge!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# We celebrate Irish-Americans March 17, Italian-Americans March 26, German-Americans in Oktoberfest, on and on. Until those "hyphens" want to give up their identities, everyone who is from someplace other than here originally can leave. Make indigenous people happy.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# OMG - what vile and disgusting fool does that? Gross beyond words. GLAD they arrested him! We were warned at the stadium in Nuremberg that law applied.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# This was recorded Feb. 2020. It may involve people whom you know. It's the Eastman memo tactical discussion. Did it lead to the phony docs? You may know a lot about who's in this. #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Not to mention very strong support for unions and trade schoolvoc education. Bernie has no clue what WC people need, but he has no clue the WC isn't just white guys in the Rust Belt now. I used to teach those folks and love them, but they aren't Berners.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# And the DC police said, "Bring it on". This time they're ready, the Guard and every other security force will be on hand. This WILL could trigger the insurrection act lawfully bringing troops into the mess. Do you feel lucky, MAGA people? Well, do you?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# We have the capacity to stop it all. It is NOT universal, and we can see major cracks in their plans. VOTE and watch the DOJ sue for violations of the VRA. They have already won two cases in swing states.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# In Anglican tradition (whether it's yours or not) decorations don't come down until "Twelfth Night" (12 days of Christmas) when the Magi were supposed to have arrived. That's Jan. 6. You're in the ballpark just fine.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yes, how productive. We would have him go indi, caucus w the GOP, and Mitch would be in charge.  Way to go, Branch Bernardians!  You showed him - you lost the Senate for us, but you SHOWED him!!!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I have high eggnog standards.  I'm NOT backing down.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# PRRI's survey 2020 showed this extreme form of religion has dropped FAST from 24% of America to 13%. The violence in the Capitol and country will not help. "Walkaways" make the fast growing religious movement now. People leaving RW churches. This won't help.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I do think that would be attractive to a wide audience.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# That was from hanging around people such as you, Marj. You're next.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I have to take exception to this though I have great respect for some very fine police. In my city, as the mob (NOT BLM protesters as later arrests showed) stormed our area, the police WALKED AWAY. A 28-block area was utterly trashed. NO ONE stopped them. No accounting ever done.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I said that day it took only 400 years for him to be recognized as fully human. Can't decide if I'm happy with the sentence or horrified it took this long. The judge was awesome and in a VERY quiet, understated way. Maybe this is the way forward.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# If you can fire people for drug use as a hazard to others, not being vaccinated is the same.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Used to go to Christmas Eve at an Episcopal Cathedral where, as the postlude, the organist would hit a bass note not heard but felt. It was truly awesome. Great organs accomplish their goal of shaking one to the foundations.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# OMG yes!  It is too dangerous for any other alternative. Nope is exactly the right response!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Used to live in the area. Get 1/2 inch the world comes to an end. Do NOT drive there no matter how good your snow skills are. Nobody else has a clue.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# He's all that (in a negative sense) but the prime artist of the "doing things over and over expecting different outcomes" insanity. Nobody stole 2016 from Bern. Nobody rigged 2020. We just don't like Bernie, and we never will.  Give it up, Shaun. Bern is a has been who never was.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# And then we have the judge at the Arbery trial who was a model of fairness.  Gives one hope, it does.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# How can EMTs and crime scene investigators not be among our strongest gun control advocates? Can you IMAGINE dealing with this?  It's devastating. And it's avoidable.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# First ask if they will set another channel. If not, yeah - get out of there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Damned right.  This eggnog debacle was the LAST STRAW.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# It might mean NOT being on Medicaid but ACA proper.  Try #URL# to see your options.  If you are at or below 250% of the FPL, it's VERY reasonable. It's tied to your income.  At least it WAS - I'm not up to date on current status, but I think Biden restored that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# That is a really good idea IF one can get a cab to downtown or some motel.  Love the Lakeshore Ltd.!]]></document>
