(For context, I posted an anti-drug news article from the 60s talking about how LSD was a "weapon in the hands of anarchists" in r/LSD and the broader conversation is about how it can be a powerful tool for seeing the world in different ways) #URL#]]></document>

Do with this information what you will.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There's a bot that automatically retweets mentions of Solarpunk and a bot that automatically retweets any tweet that says It's the Nutshack so I put both in this tweet solely for the unholy crossover it would cause.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# AGP is literally made up bullshit which is largely discredited due to the numerous massive holes in the typology. It doesn't exist.

Also how the fuck are furries a manifestation of self loathing or whatever the fuck?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# You realize I've been sexually abused by women, right?nnCisgender men do commit most violent crime, but trying to frame the entire demographic as the enemy instead of addressing the issues that lead to that is the logic of the alt right.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It is my personal belief that the legalization of psychedelic drugs should coincide with a massive increase in art subsidies because psychedelic drugs have been very definitively linked with increased creativity]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# "Oh, so you have a problem with someone engaging in a smear campaign against another person to the point of literally accusing them of running a sex cult with no evidence, then refusing to apologize to them? Get a hobby!"

I've seen the same rhetoric from TERFs]]></document>

Make up an incredibly cursed ideology after reacting to the made up cursed ideology above you.

Since this is the first tweet in the thread and thus there's nobody above to react to, I'll start:

Matriarchal Two-Party Marxism-Leninism-TERFism]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Have you ever seen GCs talk about trans men?
