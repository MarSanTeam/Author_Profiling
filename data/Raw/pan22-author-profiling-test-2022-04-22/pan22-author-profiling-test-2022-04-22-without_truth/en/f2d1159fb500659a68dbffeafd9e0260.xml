If you aren't telling the truth, clearly you don't feel sorry for what you said. And after so many years... it's time to move on. People are dicks on the net.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Now do I want you to start hating on Kyle or trolling him? No.

That's not what "yous" want. I just want you guys to be consistent in your thinking and all and stop acting like Steve is the next hitler. Even if trolling happened, there are many that ran with Steve who did that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# How many times have they claimed to destroy someone or that something will fail and it turned out to be false?

All I can say is, if that's how Menace acts with a video like I did. Wait til I show people that he doesn't know what doxxing is.]]></document>

They did kite man raw I say.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# But you said the other side or others do the same to him and others.

So my question is, why act like steve is somehow unique in this regard now knowing both sides do this?]]></document>

Not sure why it's that shocking.

Also, how isn't soft core not porn?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I don't know, as I haven't done a ton of research into steve. And if he does do that, you might just have to let it go. Report it and move on.

There's tons of people out there doing stuff like him, and as much as I wish I could be some form of superman and all, I can't.]]></document>

For someone to go after Steve cause she claims he was a dick to her and her husband years ago... she doesn't let things go and move on.]]></document>

Why would he give aid to people who chased him down and attacked him? That's a dumb question...]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# It has something to do with Steve jokingly yelling that put on a nss when you guys started talking about KJP that theve taken to a ridiculous level.

Outside their own circle... next to no one knows what all these memes are about. And this has been goin on for 2 months now?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yep, but you have to remember. Menace can't call out his friends for stuff.

It's "rules for thee, but not for me and my friends".]]></document>
