That’s probably where I disagree most with some otherwise reasonable socialists as well as anti-socialist liberals. I see it all as different points on one progressive line.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I have personal animosity toward the Ike stans. Ike had all the same awful cold war FP as Truman, LBJ or JFK but without the domestic social reform (or attempted reform) that they had. All we got out of him was highways and that was a bipartisan thing w/o heavy lifting.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# As an aside, it’s amazing how much more concerned people are for the “forgotten people” who are white and live in the Midwest than the generally worse-off people of color living in the cities. But again, the narrative isn’t even really true.]]></document>
