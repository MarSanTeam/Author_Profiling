You aren't saving anyone by being transphobic. You're putting women in danger by ignoring those who are majority responsible for prison rapes. It's not trans women. You are a bigger threat to cis women than trans women.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# The average life expectancy of Black trans women is 35 years old.

Dehumanizing rhetoric under the lazy premise of it "just being comedy" still manifests itself in violence, and it's mainly Black trans women/TWOC having to deal with the real-life consequences.]]></document>

You don't think Trump's racist jokes emboldened racists?

Do you think transphobia isn't systemic or something?]]></document>

Do you think he asked his daughter for consent to frame the tweet this way? Misgendering isn't okay, and cis parents need to be more considerate of boundaries and feelings of their trans kids.
