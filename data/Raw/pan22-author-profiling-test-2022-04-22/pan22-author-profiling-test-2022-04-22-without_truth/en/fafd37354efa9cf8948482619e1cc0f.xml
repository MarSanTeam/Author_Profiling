		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# I appreciate your clarification of what happened.

There's a helluva lot of talk about how police ought to be trained to "de-escalate" volatile situations. That could've come in handy in incidents like this. But I guess that won't get clicks, or eyeballs on the newscasts. Right?]]></document>
