Have you ever watched a biographical movie of a certain person that lived IRL and the portrait story is somewhat accurate but at the very end of the movie they state that nothing is based on real life events?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Well they do only name dropping of things because they sound cool. The term "Neutral Zone" sounds unique, geeky and soooooo cooool so they "just" used it in a dialog. What is there more to make sense of!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Yes the problem is that the Kurtzman Trek stuff isn't made for the live long fans but just a tool to drive us away from Trek and leave them alone.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Looks like the usual bullies. When they are out of there "arguments" they resort to kindergarten behavior. What do you think #USER#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Well technically it must be captainS as in one that got his commission from "making the admiral really happy" and being from the mirror universe and technically no permanent captain for the whole second season.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well in my opinion only someone who wants to nitpick stuff and wants to be a dick could criticize these as not being true to TOS and now ground to seriously hate on them. Also they are much more better looking compared to the DISC one.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well they already have done it in Discovery! You are definitely late as of summer 2017. These are now how the Klingons look under Kurtzman. I don't see a way that they admit that they made an error in changing them that much!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# hm an add for Kitchen Appliances. - you mean like woman in a kitchen want to have and where they belong! A fine piece of feminist propaganda! #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well that is in my opinion very revealing how disconnected the creators of this "Star Trek" really are. Even the more supporting actors have realized how big of shit show this is for the life long fanbase and the potential to anger a considerate amount of fans.]]></document>

A ship here or there and some neat technology on the down low.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I for one think that Secret Hideout has a somewhat difficult worded contract for the license to not use former Star Trek creatives or has a severe monetization handicap if they use them and it all looks too similar to the former CBS canon.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yes pages that do this are not worth my time. This interaction is the first and only page impression they will get from me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Well it was a prequel before everything was established in Starfleet and the whole rulebook not written yet. Also nobody tried to show a very advanced technology in an era that it was not fitting like they did in Disc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well #USER# discovered this.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# In hindsight it is my opinion that every creative that works on crappy Sci-Fi took the later seasons of BSG and Caprica as a blueprint for what people want in Sci-Fi and how to convey an ideology to the viewers and educate them in this ideology.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# So you have seen it or already and can say that the trailer is basically exactly what the story is with all the interesting scenes in it the show sop the trailer is basically spoiling the whole season?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hey #USER# #USER# #USER# what do you think of Pandora on CW. I didn't expected much but somehow I enjoyed it. It shows to me that it is created by someone that knows Star Trek. Creator is #USER#  and a buddy of #USER# ...-&gt;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# How well a country is not doomed you can gouge is that that the most productive things there politicians can think of is to argue about if you should or should not name that virus the China Virus.

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Considering Destiny is several thousands or millions year old I'd choose Voyager. Much less maintenance needed and much less complicated.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Hey that is Pike with TWO "Klingons".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Well to me it sounds like that they want to get rid of her by giving her a wired kind of participation trophy for her being "snatched up" by someone else. Basically to make her more desirable to get a "better" (for CBS and Kurtzman) offer for another show.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# I don't think the writers have actually grasp the concept what Trills are. Maybe they only saw the (sexy) skin markings of Jadzia and Esri Dax and didn't looked any further into them. They chose them only for the looks.

What else were they supposed to do? #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Hey hasn't also the murdering science lady booked a session with the EAEH (Emergency Adult Entertainment Hologram) #HASHTAG# #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well I really liked TFA and got really hyped up for TLJ and after some reflection I really hated it. I am probably will never watch number 9. Just consider how Rian Johnson acted out on Twitter after people dared to criticized him. The same headlines behavior we got from Trek.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Even there self produced shows has fixed times when it is available in which region sometimes stretching there release 6 months apart. I certainly don't expect Picard to watch legally with my #USER# account here in Austria when it is released on Amazon!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Also in most of Europe the first Gulf war is seen as follows: Hussain asked especially the US if it was ok to annex seen as there province Kuwait. Nobody indicated that they had a problem with. Then the tanks rolled into Kuwait.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Well with Discovery there are actually very few actors that say this stuff like he does and the rest really know how the fans react when you blame them. They just say nothing or when they have to say something it is very neutral!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It is really interesting that the Disc crowd can't muster more "hype" in social media about voting for this. That should give #USER# and #USER# a deep think about how valid is the thing they do with Disc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I had to look him up which confirmed my suspicion that there is somebody who knows Trek or is a life long Trek fan.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Hey I think they realized that nobody would buy such a "goody" bag of "Trek"

Well on the other hand they needed some cheap things to pay the shills with.

Seems they got rid of it. #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Oh wait isn't that a Motorola Razr I had in the early 00s (not that new 2019 shitty one)?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Well SJWs are not known for respecting history or at least interpret it as how they see fit. So we possibly could see that everything that Archer, Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway (probably not) were at fault why the Federation is that fucked up in Disc future.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Don't you think that is "about" more than 4 seasons too late?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# well the "I don't care anymore" is clearly missing. Take that as my answer.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Just not explaining why the Klingons look that different is a big middle finger to everybody that has that expectation of being true to the expected era.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# yes me too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Well in my opinion admitting that thing would basically invalidate every argument of them that all there "Trek" is factually Trek and that they are trying everything to adhere to canon. Such a bombshell would vaporize any validity of there stuff for an huge part of the fanbase.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Wait isn't Kurtzman making the "bulk" (in the meaning of the whole is very little) of that merchandising money with his abysmal "designs" of 25% difference?

So my question is how much is CBS actually profiting from Trek? IMO it seems to be more the kind of heavy anchor of loss.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You are all fools if you only see 1 Klingon!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# In season 2 I literally played the game "Now in which other Sci-Fi have I seen this thing before" The only somewhat "original" of Disc are the horrible stories, extensive blinding lens flares and the wonky angled and vertigo inducing camera pans.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Also apprentices in there field are expected and tested to the point they for example don't burn down your house because they don't know how to wire the house.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# It is really sad which kind of "Trek fans" Kurtzman has attracted to Star Trek.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# What about more #USER#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Also I kind of zoned out of Westworld very early in the first season.

And then on place 15: Devs. I would say that this show looks more like a mystery thriller with the topic "silicon valley is bad and nobody knows what goes on there"! Is that what goes for SciFi these days?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Oh yes make them harder to google for.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Since Moonves got Star Trek "gifted" by slicing up the old Viacom (which was only done to please the shareholders) nobody understood what made Trek successful. Then CBS didn't hire on merit but in a kind of casting couch or it was more important what check box they could tick.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I hope you know how in TOS Klingon looked and then how they looked in TNG, DS9, VOY and ENT. It isn't even somehow explained why they look that different. This is not a visual update of how they looked previously.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Yes him. I've determent a short while ago that I am seriously not interested in what ever nonsense he deems he has to communicate.

After all his posse can get very unreasonable when you openly argue against him in public.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Well here in Europe consumer advocacy and privacy groups will probably crucify a company for trying to do this. It is as an European astonishing how much is purposely not really strict regulated around privacy issues in the US.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Hm (wrong franchise?) #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Just imagine what stupid thing they will do when they think they have no restraints of canon (how they defined Trek canon!!!!)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Yup but ... #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Well if I needed "just" one reason more to not watch TROS they gave me one with this "article".

After all is it mandatory to watch the movie for being a Russian troll.

Very unusual marketing thing from Lucasfilm to shit on the critiques of the last move before the next one.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Well doesn't rule 34 applies here?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Well for the purpose of reporting it to the shareholders/owners it is then considered to be earnings.

Otherwise it cooking the books these ways it wouldn't make sense to do such a thing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Well then be entertained by that. LOL #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Strange times we live in when some made up "rumor" by a Dreckie are way more entertaining than actually watching Star Trek.

That IMO says a lot about how fucked up the Trek fandom as a whole is!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# I mean it has a disclamer, dogs and Wendy's in it. (just skimming btw.) All the episodes are 40 min. long and even the second part has over 800k views. There seems to be an audience for mostly showing of somebody with mostly grany homeviedo made into a dokumentary.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# You mean Trump failed at securing the US election beforehand and securing the Supreme Court beforehand against all the Democrats that all have a overwhelming majority in both houses and in the highest court of the country? #HASHTAG#]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Wait Canon or canon? #URL#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Oh look the Empress]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Now I think that marketing is saying what ever it needs to trick people into subscribing to CBSAA after they saw the reactions to the articles they let Steward do. I don't think it is particularly going well when they have to resort to such tactics.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yesterday we had the notion of true Trekies can have a discussion of adults with proper arguments. Now see how all the Youtubers that like #HASHTAG# and #HASHTAG# react when you when you criticize one of them.

That would have meant that all the fancy effects would have looked very shitty. The rest is a pretty senseless story that nobody would follow.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# In the end the message and what he has to say is what really matters as a Youtuber like him. At what point does he become the busy fool which should not be admired for his work?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Well the thing is that Starfleet and the Federation knew of that harvesting and in the best case did nothing or even participated in that. Portraying the Federation and Starfleet just as some incompetent morally bankrupt people is one of the big complains we have.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# By the time Disc rolled around #USER# deemed the only thing wrong was that it was stated to be not cannon. So he tried and failed to shoehorn it into established cannon and that failed very miserable. In a way the bigger crime is Disc!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Well they don't want us Star Trek fans to like anything they make. So from there perspective they target the audience they want to have. I only question why they haven't figured out that they make "Trek" for normies that won't buy there "nerdy" stuff.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# Also #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Yes that makes this conversation funny! #HASHTAG#]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# My point is that the former truth reporting old media reports on controversial stuff more or less only the press releases of corporations and maybe put there special kind of partisan spin on it if not posting it word for word without evaluating what is marketing spin or not.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# #USER# Well he just linked a PP video about how Star Trek now is super into Pride Month. Sooo that he pull the racist card is the only thing that makes SOME sense to me about his "counterpoint"

		<document><![CDATA[#USER# #USER# Well DS9 was very much about (the Bajorian) religion and there were always the episodes where religion was front and center. Also the Bajoran were allowed to wear there ear clips. What Trek never was is to have someone as a token to have this token in the show.]]></document>
